    "## Objectives\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to **collect, consolidate, and prepare datasets** that will be used to build data-driven insights for the *Book Subscription Optimization* project.  \n",
    "This aligns with the **Data Collection and Understanding** stages of the CRISP-DM process, ensuring that the data foundation supports later stages of modeling and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook aims to:\n",
    "- Retrieve and load multiple book-related datasets from open sources.  \n",
    "- Perform initial validation to assess structure, completeness, and consistency. \n",
    "- Note any data quality issues for future cleaning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "- **Goodbooks-10k Dataset:** User-book interactions and ratings, used to simulate subscription platform interactions.  \n",
    "- **Best Books Ever Dataset:** Global book metadata and ratings, used for cross-platform popularity validation and content catalogue proxy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset contributes unique dimensions: reader behavior, book features, and market data. This structure allows for a holistic analysis of book engagement and satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "- Metadata summary of dataset structure, completeness, and variable distributions.  \n",
    "- Preliminary insights into data coverage for later CRISP-DM stages (Data Understanding & Preparation).\n",
    "- Original datasets saved in CSV format for reproducibility and future use.\n",
    "\n",
