The second chapter walks through the way what we see determines our thoughts, and demonstrates the counterintuitive point that believing is in fact seeing.

The fourth chapter explores the bizarre world of synesthetes, people who see colors in numbers, textures in smells, sounds in sights, and flavors in sounds. Finally, V. S.

189369.Radical_Enlightenment,Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650-1750,,Jonathan I. Israel,4.19,"In the wake of the Scientific Revolution, the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the complete demolition of traditional structures of authority, scientific thought, and belief by the new philosophy and the philosophers, including Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau. The Radical Enlightenment played a part in this revolutionary process, which effectively overthrew all justification for monarchy, aristocracy, and ecclesiastical power, as well as man's dominance over woman, theological dominance of education, and slavery. Despite the present day interest in the revolutions of the eighteenth century, the origins and rise of the Radical Enlightenment have received limited scholarly attention. The greatest obstacle to the movement finding its proper place in modern historical writing is its international scope: the Radical Enlightenment was not French, British, German, Italian, Jewish or Dutch, but all of these at the same time.In this wide-ranging volume, Jonathan Israel offers a novel interpretation of the Radical Enlightenment down to La Mettie and Diderot, two of its key exponents. Particular emphasis is placed on the pivotal role of Spinoza and the widespread underground international philosophical movement known before 1750 as Spinozism.",English,9780199254569,"['Philosophy', 'History', 'European History', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Science', '18th Century', 'France']",[],Paperback,,834,"Oxford University Press, USA",September 12th 2002,11/06/01,['Leo Gershoy Award (2001)'],301,"['131', '115', '37', '16', '2']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388926959l/189369.jpg,92,1,24.64,189369.0

173165.The_Hungry_Ocean,The Hungry Ocean: A Swordboat Captain's Journey,,Linda Greenlaw,3.81,"The term fisherwoman does not exactly roll trippingly off the tongue, and Linda Greenlaw, the world's only female swordfish boat captain, isn't flattered when people insist on calling her one. ""I am a woman. I am a fisherman. . . I am not a fisherwoman, fisherlady, or fishergirl. If anything else, I am a thirty-seven-year-old tomboy. It's a word I have never outgrown."" Greenlaw also happens to be one of the most successful fishermen in the Grand Banks commercial fleet, though until the publication of Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm, ""nobody cared."" Greenlaw's boat, the Hannah Boden, was the sister ship to the doomed Andrea Gail, which disappeared in the mother of all storms in 1991 and became the focus of Junger's book. The Hungry Ocean, Greenlaw's account of a monthlong swordfishing trip over 1,000 nautical miles out to sea, tells the story of what happens when things go right -- proving, in the process, that every successful voyage is a study in narrowly averted disaster. There is the weather, the constant danger of mechanical failure, the perils of controlling five sleep-, women-, and booze-deprived young fishermen in close quarters, not to mention the threat of a bad fishing run: ""If we don't catch fish, we don't get paid, period. In short, there is no labor union."" Greenlaw's straightforward, uncluttered prose underscores the qualities that make her a good captain, regardless of gender: fairness, physical and mental endurance, obsessive attention to detail. But, ultimately, Greenlaw proves that the love of fishing -- in all of its grueling, isolating, suspenseful glory -- is a matter of the heart and blood, not the mind.

How does nature produce the right numbers of zebras and lions on the African savanna, or fish in the ocean? How do our bodies produce the right numbers of cells in our organs and bloodstream? In ""The Serengeti Rules,"" award-winning biologist and author Sean Carroll tells the stories of the pioneering scientists who sought the answers to such simple yet profoundly important questions, and shows how their discoveries matter for our health and the health of the planet we depend upon.One of the most important revelations about the natural world is that everything is regulated--there are rules that regulate the amount of every molecule in our bodies and rules that govern the numbers of every animal and plant in the wild. And the most surprising revelation about the rules that regulate life at such different scales is that they are remarkably similar--there is a common underlying logic of life. Carroll recounts how our deep knowledge of the rules and logic of the human body has spurred the advent of revolutionary life-saving medicines, and makes the compelling case that it is now time to use the Serengeti Rules to heal our ailing planet.A bold and inspiring synthesis by one of our most accomplished biologists and gifted storytellers, ""The Serengeti Rules"" is the first book to illuminate how life works at vastly different scales.

It divides into two parts, each of which provides enough material for a one-semester graduate course. The first part deals chiefly with the isotropic and homogeneous average universe; the second part concentrates on the departures from the average universe. Throughout the book the author presents detailed analytic calculations of cosmological phenomena, rather than just report results obtained elsewhere by numerical computation. The book is up to date, and gives detailed accounts of topics such as recombination, microwave background polarization, leptogenesis, gravitational lensing, structure formation, and multifield inflation, that are usually treated superficially if at all in treatises on cosmology. Copious references to current research literature are supplied.

Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.",English,9780316769174,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Literature', 'School', 'Novels', 'Coming Of Age', 'American', 'High School', 'Read For School']","['Holden Caulfield', 'Robert Ackley', 'Stradlater', 'Phoebe Caulfield', 'Allie Caulfield', 'D.B Caulfield', 'Sally Hayes', 'Holden Caufield', 'Robert Ackley', 'Stradlater', 'Phoebe Caulfield', 'Allie Caulfield', 'D.B Caulfield', 'Sally Hayes']",Paperback,First Back Bay Paperback Edition (US/CAN),277,Back Bay Books,01/30/01,07/16/51,"['Teen Read Award Nominee for Best All-Time-Fave (2010)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1952)']",2736523,"['937208', '846027', '579292', '234980', '139016']",86.0,"['New York City, New York (United States)', 'Agerstown, Pennsylvania (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398034300l/5107.jpg,603268,6533,2.6,5107.0

The trilogy is an international sensation that will grab you and keep you “reading with eyes wide open” (San Francisco Chronicle). “[It] is intricately plotted, lavishly detailed but written with a breakneck pace and verve” (The Independent, U.K.), but “be warned: the trilogy is seriously addictive.” (The Guardian, U.K.).“Believe the hype . . .

  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
  
Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden’s wealthiest families disappeared without a trace more than forty years ago. All these years later, her aged uncle continues to try to discover what happened to her. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist recently sidelined by a libel conviction, to investigate. Blomkvist is aided by the pierced and tattooed computer prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and astonishing corruption on their way to discovering the truth of Harriet Vanger’s fate.
  The Girl Who Played with Fire
  
Mikael Blomkvist, now the crusading publisher of the magazine Millennium, has decided to run a story that will expose an extensive sex trafficking operation. On the eve of its publication, the two reporters responsible for the article are murdered, and the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to his friend Lisbeth Salander. Blomkvist, convinced of Salander’s innocence, plunges into an investigation of the murders. Meanwhile, Salander herself is drawn into a murderous game of cat and mouse, which forces her to face her dark past.
  The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest
Lisbeth Salander lies in critical condition, a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city hospital. She’s fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, she’ll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. On her own, she will plot revenge—against the man who tried to kill her, and against the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life.

About to graduate college and pursue her dreams of becoming a professional ballerina, Candace decides it’s time to let go and have a little fun. But fun is short-lived when a brutal attack leaves her completely shattered.  The memories that consume and torment Candace are starting to destroy her when she meets Ryan Campbell, a successful bar owner. He feels instantly connected and tries to show her that hope is worth fighting for. But is Ryan harboring his own demons?

Escaping California and moving to Seattle to attend the University of Washington, Jase frees himself to the reality that he likes men. Never staying with any guy long enough to get to know them, he doesn’t realize that he’s still hiding from who he is until he meets Mark.

All of the characters—soldiers, civilians—struggle to discover that what matters most is not that they’ve caused no harm, but how they make amends for the harm they’ve caused.The Standard Grand confronts a glaring cultural omission: the absence of women in our war stories.

The twenty-six-year-old has abandoned the dangerous obligations pressed upon her by her father, and chosen instead to live a normal life. But Maya comes from a long line of people who call themselves Harlequins—a fierce group of warriors willing to sacrifice their lives to protect a select few known as Travelers.Gabriel and Michael Corrigan are brothers living in Los Angeles. Since childhood, the young men have been shaped by stories that their late father was a Traveler, one of a small band of prophets who have vastly influenced the course of history. Travelers are able to attain pure enlightenment, and have for centuries ushered change into the world. Gabriel and Michael, who may have inherited their father's gifts, have always protected themselves by living “off the Grid”—that is, invisible to the real-life surveillance networks that monitor people in our modern society.Summoned by her ailing father, Maya is told of the existence of the brothers. The Corrigans are in severe danger, stalked by powerful men known as the Tabula—ruthless mercenaries who have hunted Travelers for generations. This group is determined to inflict order on the world by controlling it, and they view Travelers as an intolerable threat. As Maya races to California to protect the brothers, she is reluctantly pulled back into the cold and solitary Harlequin existence. A colossal battle looms—one that will reveal not only the identities of Gabriel and Michael Corrigan but also a secret history of our time.Moving from the back alleys of Prague to the heart of Los Angeles, from the high deserts of Arizona to a guarded research facility in New York, The Traveler explores a parallel world that exists alongside our own.

Star of action blockbuster Alpha Papa; a man with a fascinating past and an amazing future.Gregarious and popular, yet Alan’s never happier than when relaxing in his own five-bedroom, south-built house with three acres of land and access to a private stream. But who is this mysterious enigma?Alan Gordon Partridge is the best – and best-loved – radio presenter in the region. Born into a changing world of rationing, Teddy Boys, apes in space and the launch of ITV, Alan’s broadcasting career began as chief DJ of Radio Smile at St. Luke’s Hospital in Norwich. After replacing Peter Flint as the presenter of Scout About, he entered the top 8 of BBC sports presenters.But Alan’s big break came with his primetime BBC chat show Knowing Me, Knowing You. Sadly, the show battled against poor scheduling, having been put up against News at Ten, then in its heyday. Due to declining ratings, a single catastrophic hitch (the killing of a guest on air) and the dumbing down of network TV, Alan’s show was cancelled. Not to be dissuaded, he embraced this opportunity to wind up his production company, leave London and fulfil a lifelong ambition to return to his roots in local radio.Now single, Alan is an intensely private man but he opens up, for the second time, in this candid, entertaining, often deeply emotional – and of course compelling – memoir, written entirely in his own words. (Alan quickly dispelled the idea of using a ghost writer. With a grade B English Language O-Level, he knew he was up to the task.)He speaks touchingly about his tragic Toblerone addiction, and the painful moment when unsold copies of his first autobiography, Bouncing Back, were pulped like ‘word porridge’. He reveals all about his relationship with his ex-Ukrainian girlfriend, Sonja, with whom he had sex at least twice a day, and the truth about the thick people who make key decisions at the BBC.A literary tour de force, I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan charts the incredible journey of one of our greatest broadcasters.",English,9780007449170,"['Humor', 'Fiction', 'Comedy', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature', 'Biography Memoir', 'Pop Culture', 'Novels', 'Tv', 'Modern']",[],Hardcover,,320,HarperCollins,September 29th 2011,01/01/11,[],8282,"['3633', '3160', '1208', '221', '60']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1494078833l/12363948._SY475_.jpg,100,1,2.78,12363948.0

Thus begins In the Company of the Courtesan, Sarah Dunant's epic novel of life in Renaissance Italy. Escaping the sack of Rome in 1527, with their stomachs churning on the jewels they have swallowed, the courtesan Fiammetta and her dwarf companion, Bucino, head for Venice, the shimmering city born out of water to become a miracle of east-west trade: rich and rancid, pious and profitable, beautiful and squalid.With a mix of courage and cunning they infiltrate Venetian society. Together they make the perfect partnership: the sharp-tongued, sharp-witted dwarf, and his vibrant mistress, trained from birth to charm, entertain, and satisfy men who have the money to support her.Yet as their fortunes rise, this perfect partnership comes under threat, from the searing passion of a lover who wants more than his allotted nights to the attentions of an admiring Turk in search of human novelties for his sultan's court. But Fiammetta and Bucino's greatest challenge comes from a young crippled woman, a blind healer who insinuates herself into their lives and hearts with devastating consequences for them all.A story of desire and deception, sin and religion, loyalty and friendship, In the Company of the Courtesan paints a portrait of one of the world's greatest cities at its most potent moment in history: It is a picture that remains vivid long after the final page.",English,9780812974041,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Italy', '16th Century', 'Audiobook', 'Romance', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels', 'Art']",[],Paperback,,368,Random House Trade,February 6th 2007,10/28/06,[],23776,"['5817', '9178', '6803', '1521', '457']",92.0,"['Venice (Italy)', 'Rome (Italy)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924737l/62212.jpg,255,3,2.79,62212.0

Feldman (1926-1987) was deeply immersed in the milieu of New York Abstract Expressionism, and found analogies in sound to the materiality of Pollock, the gravitas of Rothko and the hesitant, venturing brushstrokes of Guston. Taking as its departure point an exhibition Feldman curated in 1967 titled Six Painters, Vertical Thoughts considers the impact that postwar American art had on Feldman's own compositions. It features works by the six painters -- Guston, Kline, Mondrian, de Kooning, Pollock and Rothko -- and by other artists whom Feldman admired, such as Kitaj, Rauschenberg and Twombly. Also reproduced are works from Feldman's own collection, including his Middle Eastern and Asian rugs, archival photographs and ephemera, musical scores and record covers of compositions dedicated to artists such as Guston and Rothko, besides interviews with and writings by Feldman himself.",English,9781907020087,"['Art', 'Music', 'Essays', 'Nonfiction']",[],Paperback,,319,Irish Museum of Modern Art,July 31st 2010,11/06/10,[],24,"['15', '8', '1', '0', '0']",100.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347240284l/8182179.jpg,90,1,173.48,8182179.0

625561.No_Unhallowed_Hand,No Unhallowed Hand,The Work and the Glory #7,Gerald N. Lund (Goodreads Author),4.34,"“Joshua,” said Brigham, “three years ago, Joseph wrote to a Mr. John Wentworth, and one of the things he said was this. 'The standard of truth has been erected, and no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing. It will not stop until the purposes of God are accomplished and the great Jehovah shall say to us, the work is done!'”Now Brigham's voice quivered with excitement; his eyes burned with intensity. “That's what we're offering here, Joshua. Those men with their painted faces stormed Carthage Jail and thought they had stopped the work. Well, what an enormous shock this will be to them! They're driving us from the state, thinking that will end it. But give us ten years. Fifteen years! And then even a blind man will know that no unhallowed hand can stop this work.”Picking up the story shortly after the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, No Unhallowed Hand — volume 7 in the series The Work and the Glory — takes the saga of the Restoration the the fictional Steed family from the end of June 1844 to February 1846.As this volume opens, it is a time of great sadness and of uncertainty. Having lost their beloved prophet, the Saints witness a series of power plays by those who would use the opportunity to further their own interests. It is not long, however, before the Lord's purposes are made apparent and the Twelve take their rightful position as leaders of the Church, with Brigham Young at their head. For a time, an uneasy peace seems to prevail in Illinois, but then the Nauvoo Charter is revoked, anti-Mormon hatred is again inflamed by those involved in the Prophet's death, mobs burn homes in small Mormon settlements, and eventually the Saints again find themselves faced with the threat of violent expulsion unless they agree to leave the state. The situation promises to divide the Steeds. Who among them will go west and who will stay? What will Joshua's and Melissa's part-member families do?This installment in the series contains not only its share of fascinating real-life history, but also a number of plot twists involving the Steeds that will keep readers engaged from beginning to end. The story of their lives underscores the prophetic nature of Joseph Smith's words that, indeed, “no unhallowed hand can stop the work.”",,9781590387252,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Spirituality', 'Adult Fiction', 'Christian Fiction']",[],Paperback,,656,Deseret Book,February 1st 2007,10/15/96,[],8831,"['4508', '3015', '1149', '140', '19']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266601545l/625561.jpg,80,1,6.47,625561.0

Anderson's dazzling debut presents the haunting story of a world where something has gone horribly awry . . . Having escaped from Australia's Adelaide Zoo, an orphaned platypus named Albert embarks on a journey through the outback in search of ""Old Australia,"" a rumored land of liberty, promise, and peace. What he will find there, however, away from the safe confinement of his enclosure for the first time since his earliest memories, proves to be a good deal more than he anticipated. Alone in the outback, with an empty soft drink bottle as his sole possession, Albert stumbles upon pyromaniacal wombat Jack, and together they spend a night drinking and gambling in Ponsby Station, a rough-and-tumble mining town. Accused of burning down the local mercantile, the duo flees into menacing dingo territory and quickly go their separate ways-Albert to pursue his destiny in the wastelands, Jack to reconcile his past. Encountering a motley assortment of characters along the way-a pair of invariably drunk bandicoots, a militia of kangaroos, hordes of the mercurial dingoes, and a former prize-fighting Tasmanian devil-our unlikely hero will discover a strength and skill for survival he never suspected he possessed. Told with equal parts wit and compassion, Albert of Adelaide shows how it is often the unexpected route, and the most improbable companions, that lead us on the path to who we really are.

It is the sequel to Eyes of Horus.Lord of the Horizon is the story, told in the first person, of Ra-ab, heir to the Nomarch of the Oryx. Ra-ab is twenty-one as the story begins. The dawn for which Ra-ab and the Watchers of the Horizon fought in Eyes of Horus has come, but to 'Send Fear into Exile', as the Watchers' password promised, proves difficult.

Like a spider, she spins a web of intrigue and manipulation which threatens to plunge Egypt back into darkness. Her prize is Amenemhet's son Senusert, who will one day be Pharaoh himself. Finally, Pharaoh realizes what has occurred, and calls on his friend Ra-ab Hotep, hero of the revolution, to take Senusert to his home in the Oryx and help him grow up properly, so he will be ready to fulfill his duties as Pharaoh. But the Babylonian is not yet defeated. She continues to challenge Amenemhet's rule and authority, leading inexorably to the final showdown.As a child growing up in Edwardian England, Joan Grant became aware of an astonishing ability to remember previous lifetimes, and as an author professed her seven novels to be based on her personal recollections of other incarnations, male and female, in ancient civilisations.""Ra'ab, the Warrior, heir of the Peace of God... speaks with a voice that those who today are seeking illumination may welcome as the voice of a friend.""

Virginia Mendoza retrata a los que se quedaron en el pueblo cuando todos sus vecinos emigraron a las ciudades, pero también a los que abandonaron la ciudad y se fueron a vivir al campo. Permanecer o partir se convierten en actos de rebeldía e independencia. Los hombres y mujeres de estas páginas podrían ser los protagonistas de las novelas de Miguel Delibes y Julio Llamazares. Con ellos desaparecerá por completo una forma de vida basada en el arraigo a la tierra, la supervivencia y el contacto con la naturaleza más pura.«Cuando volví a mi pueblo, se había instalado una fría novedad: un tanatorio. ¿Qué iba a ser de aquellos descendientes de mi abuelo que contaban chistes junto a la puerta de los difuntos de cuerpo presente? Años después, mi abuela Francisca —la que guarda tres mortajas, por si acaso, para no molestar—, me pidió que le pinte los labios cuando muera. Empecé a creer que la gente de su generación estaba obsesionada con la muerte. Me equivocaba.

Politics Out of History is animated by the question of how we navigate the contemporary political landscape when the traditional compass points of modernity have all but disappeared. Wendy Brown diagnoses a range of contemporary political tendencies--from moralistic high-handedness to low-lying political despair in politics, from the difficulty of formulating political alternatives to reproaches against theory in intellectual life--as the consequence of this disorientation.Politics Out of History also presents a provocative argument for a new approach to thinking about history--one that forsakes the idea that history has a purpose and treats it instead as a way of illuminating openings in the present by, for example, identifying the haunting and constraining effects of past injustices unresolved. Brown also argues for a revitalized relationship between intellectual and political life, one that cultivates the autonomy of each while promoting their interlocutory potential. This book will be essential reading for all who find the trajectories of contemporary liberal democracies bewildering and are willing to engage readings of a range of thinkers--Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Spinoza, Benjamin, Derrida--to rethink democratic possibility in our time.",English,9780691070858,"['Theory', 'History', 'Politics', 'Philosophy']",[],Paperback,,193,Princeton University Press,August 26th 2001,08/06/01,[],55,"['16', '30', '9', '0', '0']",100.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347431373l/311909.jpg,97,1,10.98,311909.0

30633.The_Four_Loves,The Four Loves,,C.S. Lewis,4.14,"The Four Loves summarizes four kinds of human love--affection, friendship, erotic love, and the love of God. Masterful without being magisterial, this book's wise, gentle, candid reflections on the virtues and dangers of love draw on sources from Jane Austen to St. Augustine. The chapter on charity (love of God) may be the best thing Lewis ever wrote about Christianity. Consider his reflection on Augustine's teaching that one must love only God, because only God is eternal, and all earthly love will someday pass away:  Who could conceivably begin to love God on such a prudential ground--because the security (so to speak) is better? Who could even include it among the grounds for loving? Would you choose a wife or a Friend--if it comes to that, would you choose a dog--in this spirit? One must be outside the world of love, of all loves, before one thus calculates.  His description of Christianity here is no less forceful and opinionated than in Mere Christianity or The Problem of Pain, but it is far less anxious about its reader's response--and therefore more persuasive than any of his apologetics. When he begins to describe the nature of faith, Lewis writes: ""Take it as one man's reverie, almost one man's myth.

Former special-ops soldier Sam Brand is used to getting what he wants. What he wants is to unbutton the buttoned-down, sweet, and shy Dahlia McGregor. He’s hot to find her wild side. She’s eager to let him explore it. So he makes his proposition—no strings, no hurt feelings, and no promises—save for one: she’ll have the time of her life.After a broken engagement, Lia’s looking to someday find the right man and settle down. That’s some day. Now it’s all about the night.

But when Sam is wounded in the line of duty and left in Lia’s tender loving care, all bets are off.

Symbolist poets and writers — Stéphane Mallarmé and Maurice Maeterlinck among them — defended the play's literary brilliance. Beyond its notoriety, the drama's haunting poetic imagery, biblical cadences, and febrile atmosphere have earned it a reputation as a masterpiece of the Aesthetic movement of fin de siècle England.Written originally in French in 1892, this sinister tale of a woman scorned and her vengeance was translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas. The play inspired some of Aubrey Beardsley's finest illustrations, and an abridged version served as the text for Strauss' renowned opera of the same name. This volume reprints the complete text of the first English edition, published in 1894, and also includes ""A Note on Salomé"" by Robert Ross, Wilde's lifelong friend and literary executor.

22774596-false-christ,False Christ: Will the Antichrist Claim to Be the Jewish Messiah?,,Chris White (Goodreads Author),4.29,"The thesis of this book is that the Antichrist will attempt to present himself as the Jewish Messiah, that he will try his best to appear as if he is instituting what Jewish believers know as the Messianic Age and what Christians know as the Millennial reign.This book will show that much of what we know about the Antichrist points to the conclusion that his goal is to deceive the world into believing that the Messiah has come, that the Messiah is, in fact, God, and that he deserves the worship of the world. His destruction of the enemies of Israel in Daniel 11:40-45, his seven-year covenant, his rebuilding of the temple and starting the daily sacrifice, his eventual ending of the sacrifices and sitting in the temple to accept worship, his making Jerusalem the capital of the world, even his promotion by the False Prophet (who, this book argues, will claim to be Elijah) all support this position. This view will be presented in great detail and special attention is also given to objections to it.This book also argues that the little-known eschatological (end-time) beliefs of the Jewish theologians, according to the Talmud and other rabbinic writings, seem to encourage Jews to accept as Messiah a man with the exact characteristics of the Antichrist. Correlating to this view, we will present evidence that Islamic beliefs about the end times, as related in the Quran and the hadiths (the sayings of Muhammad), will cause them to play a very important role in the Antichrist's rise to power.this view is the earliest view of the church, it has been almost totally forgotten in recent years.

Woods (translator)",4.43,"This remarkable new translation of the Nobel Prize-winner’s great masterpiece is a major literary event.Thomas Mann regarded his monumental retelling of the biblical story of Joseph as his magnum opus. He conceived of the four parts–The Stories of Jacob, Young Joseph, Joseph in Egypt, and Joseph the Provider–as a unified narrative, a “mythological novel” of Joseph’s fall into slavery and his rise to be lord over Egypt. Deploying lavish, persuasive detail, Mann conjures for us the world of patriarchs and pharaohs, the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Palestine, and the universal force of human love in all its beauty, desperation, absurdity, and pain. The result is a brilliant amalgam of humor, emotion, psychological insight, and epic grandeur.Now the award-winning translator John E. Woods gives us a definitive new English version of Joseph and His Brothers that is worthy of Mann’s achievement, revealing the novel’s exuberant polyphony of ancient and modern voices, a rich music that is by turns elegant, coarse, and sublime.--front flap",English,9781400040018,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Germany', 'Religion', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Egypt']","['Joseph, son of Jacob (Bible)', 'Jacob (Bible)']",Hardcover,Everyman's Library #287 (US / CAN),1492,Everyman's Library (Knopf),May 10th 2005,10/28/43,['Κρατικό Βραβείο Λογοτεχνικής Μετάφρασης for Μετάφραση Έργου Ξένης Λογοτεχνίας στην Ελληνική Γλώσσα (2005)'],1605,"['990', '377', '188', '35', '15']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320550455l/88076.jpg,263,3,24.21,88076.0

Many of the traits on which modern Europe prides itself came to it from Muslim Spain. Diplomacy, free trade, open borders, the techniques of academic research, of anthropology, etiquette, fashion, various types of medicine and hospitals, all came from the great city of cities; Cordoba. The age that paved the way for the European renaissance was known as the Islamic Golden Age and a renaissance took place under the influence of the Arabs and Moorish revival of culture.

      “When a film is not a document, it is a dream. . . . At the editing table, when I run the strip of film through, frame by frame, I still feel that dizzy sense of magic of my childhood.” Bergman, who has conveyed this heady sense of wonder and vision to moviegoers for decades, traces his lifelong love affair with film in his breathtakingly visual autobiography, The Magic Lantern.More grand mosaic than linear account, Bergman’s vignettes trace his life from a rural Swedish childhood through his work in theater to Hollywood’s golden age, and a tumultuous romantic history that includes five wives and more than a few mistresses. Throughout, Bergman recounts his life in a series of deeply personal flashbacks that document some of the most important moments in twentieth-century filmmaking as well as the private obsessions of the man behind them. Ambitious in scope yet sensitively wrought, The Magic Lantern is a window to the mind of one of our era’s great geniuses. “[Bergman] has found a way to show the soul’s landscape . . . . Many gripping revelations.”—New York Times Book Review “Joan Tate’s translation of this book has delicacy and true pitch . . . The Magic Lantern is as personal and penetrating as a Bergman film, wry, shadowy, austere.”—New Republic “[Bergman] keeps returning to his past, reassessing it, distilling its meaning, offering it to his audiences in dazzling new shapes.”—New York Times “What Bergman does relate, particularly his tangled relationships with his parents, is not only illuminating but quite moving. No ‘tell-all’ book this one, but revealing in ways that much longer and allegedly ‘franker’ books are not.”—Library Journal

He is survived by one ex-wife, four adult children, an octogenarian mother, and two despondent brothers. Phil didn't know he was dead until he read it in the paper. All things considered, he took it rather well. So did Phil's brother, Mitch, the beneficiary of a 1.5 million dollar policy on Phil's life.  1992: Wastington restauranteur Harold Stegeman, famous for his thick, juicy steaks, is arrested by the Secret Service for printing counterfeit United States currency in an Idaho shed. In addition to the bogus bills, Stegeman also has a fraudulently obtained passport, a fabricated Cayman Island drivers license, and Phil Champagne's fingerprints.  When the uproarious reality of Harold Stegeman's secret identity hit the headlines, the counterfeit resurrection of Phil Champagne became one of the most celebrated and hysterically funny true-crime stories of the twentieth century. And while every supermarket tabloid and television talk show hounded after the untold story, only Edgar Award winner Burl Barer captured Champagne's confidence and received permission to detail Phil's post-mortem career of fraud, deception, trickery, lies, and fine prime rib, bringing to life the exploits of a man his family thought dead over a decade ago.  “Crisp as a freshly printed C-note.

When Agamemnon, the brutal political leader of the Greek forces, demands Briseis for himself, she finds herself caught between the two most powerful of the Greeks. Achilles refuses to fight in protest, and the Greeks begin to lose ground to their Trojan opponents. Keenly observant and coolly unflinching about the daily horrors of war, Briseis finds herself in an unprecedented position, able to observe the two men driving the Greek army in what will become their final confrontation, deciding the fate not only of Briseis's people but also of the ancient world at large.Briseis is just one among thousands of women living behind the scenes in this war—the slaves and prostitutes, the nurses, the women who lay out the dead—all of them erased by history. With breathtaking historical detail and luminous prose, Pat Barker brings the teeming world of the Greek camp to vivid life. She offers nuanced, complex portraits of characters and stories familiar from mythology, which, seen from Briseis's perspective, are rife with newfound revelations. Barker's latest builds on her decades-long study of war and its impact on individual lives—and it is nothing short of magnificent.",English,9780385544214,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Retellings', 'Adult', 'Greek Mythology', 'War', 'Audiobook']",[],Hardcover,,291,Doubleday Books,September 4th 2018,08/30/18,"['Costa Book Award Nominee for Novel (2018)', ""Women's Prize for Fiction Nominee (2019)""]",36832,"['10633', '15379', '8319', '1961', '540']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1519448688l/37969723._SY475_.jpg,98,1,6.76,37969723.0

The author of the series is Margit Sandemo. The novels are based in historical facts, mostly occurring in Scandinavia, but the fantastic is never far off. The series first began as a feuilletonin the Norwegian magazine Hjemmet. The first volume was released 1982, and the series became one of the best-selling series of novels in Scandinavia, with more than 25 million copies sold. The series has been published in at least Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, Finnish, Polish, Russian, Hungarian and most recently English.The story begins in Trondheim, Norway in 1581, with the story of Silje Arngrimsdotter, and how she comes into contact with Ice People, a community of people living in an isolated valley. From there on it follows Ice People through the centuries, with members of the clan migrating from Norway to Denmark and Sweden. Other members of the clan wind up in or visit various corners of Europe and Asia over the course of the series.Ice People are cursed with a terrible forefather, Tengel the Evil, whose actions resulted in at least one cursed individual being born in every generation. The cursed individuals were born with magical and mystical abilities, but also the potential for bottomless evil. They have also yellow eyes, malformed shoulder blades and Mongol features. Some cursed individuals fought their tendency to evil, whilst others embraced it.Each book tells a separate story, very often the story of one or a few individuals of the clan. Quite often the protagonist of each book is a female, sometimes of Ice People, but sometimes one who will marry into the clan. Many of the books also focus on the cursed individuals, their battle with their evil tendencies, and also how they utilise their powers, be it for good or evil.",Swedish,9999999999999,"['Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Supernatural', 'Modern Classics', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Mystery', 'Adventure']",[],,,,,"Best Trashy Novels

Είναι ποιήτρια της γενιάς του 1920, εκφράστηκε με έμμετρο λόγο και μίλησε με πηγαίο λυρισμό για τον έρωτα, τη ζωή και το θάνατο, που τόσο την απασχολούσαν.Πνεύμα ελεύθερο, ανένταχτο, όπως αρμόζει ίσως σε μια ποιήτρια, δεν συμβιβάζεται με τις επιταγές του κοινωνικού κατεστημένου και τον συντηρητισμό.

In trying to explain who he was and how he came to be the object of others' admiration and abuse, Rousseau analyses with unique insight the relationship between an elusive but essential inner self and the variety of social identities he was led to adopt. The book vividly illustrates the mixture of moods and motives that underlie the writing of autobiography: defiance and vulnerability, self-exploration and denial, passion, puzzlement, and detachment.

33516776-insane-clown-president,Insane Clown President: Dispatches from the 2016 Circus,,"Matt Taibbi, Victor Juhasz (Illustrations)",4.07,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - Dispatches from the 2016 election that provide an eerily prescient take on our democracy's uncertain future, by the country's most perceptive and fearless political journalist.In twenty-five pieces from Rolling Stone--plus two original essays--Matt Taibbi tells the story of Western civilization's very own train wreck, from its tragicomic beginnings to its apocalyptic conclusion. Years before the clown car of candidates was fully loaded, Taibbi grasped the essential themes of the story: the power of spectacle over substance, or even truth; the absence of a shared reality; the nihilistic rebellion of the white working class; the death of the political establishment; and the emergence of a new, explicit form of white nationalism that would destroy what was left of the Kingian dream of a successful pluralistic society.Taibbi captures, with dead-on, real-time analysis, the failures of the right and the left, from the thwarted Bernie Sanders insurgency to the flawed and aimless Hillary Clinton campaign; the rise of the ""dangerously bright"" alt-right with its wall-loving identity politics and its rapturous view of the ""Racial Holy War"" to come; and the giant fail of a flailing, reactive political media that fed a ravenous news cycle not with reporting on political ideology, but with undigested propaganda served straight from the campaign bubble. At the center of it all stands Donald J. Trump, leading a historic revolt against his own party, ""bloviating and farting his way"" through the campaign, ""saying outrageous things, acting like Hitler one minute and Andrew Dice Clay the next."" For Taibbi, the stunning rise of Trump marks the apotheosis of the new postfactual movement.Taibbi frames the reporting with original essays that explore the seismic shift in how we perceive our national institutions, the democratic process, and the future of the country. Insane Clown President is not just a postmortem on the collapse and failure of American democracy. It offers the riveting, surreal, unique, and essential experience of seeing the future in hindsight.""Scathing . . .

What began as a private online joke among interfaith friends quickly skyrocketed to meet the demands of the thousands of fans and critics of the controversial work. Within hours, the book became the #1 Bestseller in Amazon.com's Humor & Religion category! Combining actual Bible verses with more than 30 whimsical original illustrations, Awkward Moments uses humor to encourage people from all walks of life to think, perhaps for the first time, about how the Bible continues to shape our culture.  BEWARE - NOT FOR KIDS! This is definitely not your average children's Bible! If you thought the bestseller ""Go The F**k To Sleep"" was inappropriate for story-time with kids, you haven't seen anything yet! Leave it to the Bible! Foreskins Fetishes? Unicorn Murders? Boiled Babies? Messiah, MIA? Selling Daughters? Cannibalism Club? Genetic Breakthroughs? Demonic Bacon? Gagged Women? Jihad Jesus? You bet! And much more!  From the opening foreword by acclaimed author David G. McAffee, to the challenging commentaries and interactive games at the end, Awkward Moments Children's Bible is much more than an irreverent book for your coffee table! Readers of all faiths will find themselves laughing out loud while being encouraged to think about the Bible in a new way.  Let’s be honest - there are some things in the Good Book that are just... awkward! There are verses we'd like to forget or that have been changed throughout the centuries. There are many verses you’ve never heard before in church, let alone seen in your average children’s Bible! Not to mention the verses that have been added over the centuries!  Most people were raised in the faith chosen by their family. Young children learn a few Bible stories taken out of context and accept them without question. (On what basis could they possibly question their parents or church leaders?) After decades of repetition and tradition, it's understandable that we might put our beliefs on auto-pilot and just nod as a pastor repeats the verses and ideas that are already familiar and comfortable to us. It's no wonder that recent studies show an incredible lack of Biblical knowledge among Christians - 55% unable to even name the four Gospels of the New Testament - the very foundation of Christianity!  The Goal? Awkward Moments encourages readers to really understand what is in their Bibles and think for themselves about the context of Biblical teaching. The 32 color illustrations and included commentaries will likely challenge some readers to reflect on how religion continues to shape the lives and culture of future generations. If readers happen to laugh out loud and enjoy the interactive puzzles and games in the mean time - it’s just an added bonus!

The separation of the self and the physical world leads to the misuse of technology and the attempt to violently subjugate man's natural environment, leading to its destruction.Explaining man's role in the universe as a unique expression of the total universe, and interdependent on it, Alan Watts offers a new understanding of personal identity. It reveals the mystery of existence, presenting and alternative to the feelings of alienation that is prevalent in Western society, and a vision of how we can come to understand the cosmic self that is within every living thing.",,9780679723004,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Self Help', 'Buddhism', 'Zen', 'Personal Development', 'Eastern Philosophy']",[],Mass Market Paperback,,163,Vintage,August 28th 1989,10/28/66,[],16251,"['8056', '5086', '2180', '637', '292']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403166178l/60551.jpg,286,3,13.38,60551.0

Writing with humour, humanity and solid scientific information reminiscent of Stumbling on Happiness and Freakonomics, Piers Steel explains why we knowingly and willingly put off a course of action despite recognizing we'll be worse off for it.For those who surf the Web instead of finishing overdue assignments, who always say diets start tomorrow, who stay up late watching TV to put off going to sleep, The Procrastination Equation explains why we do what we do — or in this case don't — and why in Western societies we're in the midst of an escalating procrastination epidemic.Dr. Piers Steel takes on the myths and misunderstandings behind procrastination and motivation — showing us how procrastination affects our lives, health, careers and happiness and what we can do about it. With accessible prose and the benefits of new scientific research, he provides insight into why we procrastinate even though the result is that we are less happy, healthy, even wealthy. Who procrastinates and why? How many ways, big and small, do we procrastinate? How can we stop doing it? The reasons are part cultural, part psychological, part biological. And, with a million new ways to distract ourselves in the digitized world — all of which feed on our built-in impulsiveness — more of us are potentially damaging ourselves by putting things off. But Steel not only analyzes the factors that weigh us down but the things that motivate us — including understanding the value of procrastination.",English,9780307357168,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Business', 'Science', 'Reference', 'Health', 'Audiobook']",[],Hardcover,,320,Random House Canada,December 28th 2010,01/01/10,[],1940,"['538', '768', '470', '126', '38']",92.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320405262l/9514605.jpg,86,1,9.52,9514605.0

He proposes that we look at evolution as a battle between genes instead of between whole organisms. We can then view changes in phenotypes—the end products of genes, like eye color or leaf shape, which are usually considered to increase the fitness of an individual—as serving the evolutionary interests of genes.Dawkins makes a convincing case that considering one’s body, personality, and environment as a field of combat in a kind of “arms race” between genes fighting to express themselves on a strand of DNA can clarify and extend the idea of survival of the fittest.

While public attention has focused on Marines, conventional Army units, and Special Operations Forces, a lion’s share of the war-fighting has been done, under media radar, by Military Police units. These squad and platoon-sized units patrol dangerous urban streets, build up local police units to improve neighborhood stability, and conduct civic action missions. On many occasions they have rushed into a vicious firefight to come to the assistance of infantry units in desperate straits. They keep villages Taliban-free, monitor balloting sites, and interdict drug shipments. In detention centers at Camp Bucha, Iraq, Bagram, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo, Cuba they guard some of the most dangerous terrorists in history.The story is told by the soldiers themselves, recounting what they have seen and experienced, along with historical context and first-hand field observations by the author team who were provided with unique inside access. Warrior Police takes readers into the bloody streets of Iraq, the dangerous back-country of Afghanistan, and wherever our Military Police are needed.

When Emma's employer, Gerald, threatens her with losing her job if she doesn't submit to his very unwanted advances, she stumbles onto an opportunity to be a mail-order bride and decides that couldn't possibly be worse.

They had a blond Clairol wave in their hair. They wore girdles and waist-pinchers. . . . In recent years good girls join the army. They climb the corporate ladder. They go to the gym. . . . They wear painful pointy shoes. They don’t eat too much. They . . . don’t eat at all. They stay perfect. They stay thin. I could never be good.”The Good Body starts with Eve’s tortured relationship with her own “post-forties” stomach and her skirmishes with everything from Ab Rollers to fad diets and fascistic trainers in an attempt get the “flabby badness” out. As Eve hungrily seeks self-acceptance, she is joined by the voices of women from L.A. to Kabul, whose obsessions are also laid bare: A young Latina candidly critiques her humiliating “spread,” a stubborn layer of fat that she calls “a second pair of thighs.” The wife of a plastic surgeon recounts being systematically reconstructed–inch by inch–by her “perfectionist” husband. An aging magazine executive, still haunted by her mother’s long-ago criticism, describes her desperate pursuit of youth as she relentlessly does sit-ups.Along the way, Eve also introduces us to women who have found a hard-won peace with their bodies: an African mother who celebrates each individual body as signs of nature’s diversity; an Indian woman who transcends “treadmill mania” and delights in her plump cheeks and curves; and a veiled Afghani woman who is willing to risk imprisonment for a taste of ice cream. These are just a few of the inspiring stories woven through Eve’s global journey from obsession to enlightenment. Ultimately, these monologues become a personal wake-up call from Eve to love the “good bodies” we inhabit.From the Hardcover edition.",English,9780375502842,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Plays', 'Womens', 'Drama', 'Gender Studies', 'Essays', 'Memoir', 'Womens Studies', 'Theatre']",[],Hardcover,,112,Villard,November 9th 2004,01/01/04,[],2076,"['545', '668', '570', '226', '67']",86.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428178281l/531495.jpg,61,1,5.20,531495.0

Schon 8000 Jahre vor unserer Zeitrechnung finden wir in Mesopotamien geniale geometrische Muster, die auf Symmetrien und Rotationen basieren. Später, um die Zahl der Tiere einer Herde zu bestimmen oder die Grenzen eines Grundstücks zu ziehen, mussten die Menschen Zählen und Messen lernen, also Arithmetik und Geometrie erfinden.

30044.Young_Men_and_Fire,Young Men and Fire,,Norman Maclean,4.08,"     On August 5, 1949, a crew of fifteen of the United States Forest Service's elite airborne firefighters, The Smoke Jumpers, stepped into the sky above a remote forest fire in the Montana wilderness. Two hours after their jump, all but three of these men were dead or mortally burned from a ""blowup"" -- an explosive, 2,000-degree firestorm 300 feet deep and 200 feet tall -- a deadly explosion of flame and wind rarely encountered and little understood at the time.  Only seconds ahead of the approaching firestorm, the foreman, R. Wagner Dodge, throws himself into the ashes of an ""escape fire "" - and survives as most of his confused men run, their last moments obscured by smoke. The parents of the dead cry murder, charging that the foreman's fire killed their boys.  Exactly what happened in Mann Gulch that day has been obscured by years of grief and controversy. Now a master storyteller finally gives the Mann Gulch fire its due as tragedy.     These first deaths among the Forest Service's elite firefighters prompted widespread examination of federal fire policy, of the field of fire science, and of the frailty of young men. For Maclean, who witnessed the fire from the ground in August of 1949,  and even then he knew he would one day become a part of its story.  It is a story of Montana, of the ways of wildfires, firefighters, and fire scientists, and especially of a crew, young and proud, who ""hadn't learned to count the odds and to sense they might owe the universe a tragedy."" This tale is also Maclean's own, the story of a writer obsessed by a strange and human horror, unable to let the truth die with these young men, searching for the last - and lasting - word. A canvas on which to tell many stories, including the story of his research into the story itself. And finally Nature's violence colliding with human fallibility.      Haunted by these deaths for forty years, Norman Maclean returned to the scene with two of the survivors and pursues the mysteries that Mann Gulch has kept hidden since 1949.  From the words of witnesses, the evidence of history, and the research of fire scientists, Maclean at last assembles the scattered pieces of the Mann Gulch tragedy; in his last work that consumed 14 years of his life, and earned a 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award.       The excruciating detail of this book makes for a sobering reading experience. Maclean -- a former University of Chicago English professor and avid fisherman -- also wrote 
  A River Runs Through It and Other Stories
, which is set along the Missouri River, one gulch downstream from Mann Gulch.       ""A magnificent drama of writing, a tragedy that pays tribute to the dead and offers rescue to the living.... Maclean's search for the truth, which becomes an exploration of his own mortality, is more compelling even than his journey into the heart of the fire. His description of the conflagration terrifies, but it is his battle with words, his effort to turn the story of the 13 men into tragedy that makes this book a classic.""          —  from New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice, Best Books of 1992

157685.Les_Chants_de_Maldoror,Les Chants de Maldoror,,"Comte de Lautréamont, Guy Wernham (Translator)",4.18,"The macabre but beautiful work, Les Chants de Maldoror, has achieved a considerable reputation as one of the earliest and most extraordinary examples of Surrealist writing. It is a long narrative prose poem which celebrates the principle of Evil in an elaborate style and with a passion akin to religious fanaticism. The French poet-critic Georges Hugnet has written of Lautréamont: ""He terrifies, stupefies, strikes dumb. He could look squarely at that which others had merely given a passing glance.""Little is known of the author of Maldoror, Isidore Ducasse, self-styled Comte de Lautréamont, except that he was born in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1846 and died in Paris at the age of twenty-four. When first published in 1868-9, Maldoror went almost unnoticed. But in the nineties the book was rediscovered and hailed as a work of genius by such eminent writers as Huysmans, Léon Bloy, Maeterlinck, and Rémy de Gourmont. Later still, Lautréamont was to be canonized as one of their principal ""ancestors"" by the Paris Surrealists.This edition, translated by Guy Wernham, includes also a long introduction to a never-written, or now lost, volume of poetry. Thus, except for a few letters, it gives all the surviving literary work of Lautréamont.",English,9780811200820,"['Poetry', 'Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'French Literature', 'Horror', '19th Century', 'Novels', 'Surreal']",[],Paperback,,342,New Directions,January 17th 1965,10/29/69,[],3338,"['1631', '965', '522', '147', '73']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347424439l/157685.jpg,190,2,18.17,157685.0

94654.Masochism,Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty & Venus in Furs,,"Gilles Deleuze, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Jean McNeil (Translator)",4.03,"In his stunning essay, Coldness and Cruelty, Gilles Deleuze provides a rigorous and informed philosophical examination of the work of the late 19th-century German novelist Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Deleuze's essay, certainly the most profound study yet produced on the relations between sadism and masochism, seeks to develop and explain Masoch's ""peculiar way of 'desexualizing' love while at the same time sexualizing the entire history of humanity."" He shows that masochism is something far more subtle and complex than the enjoyment of pain, that masochism has nothing to do with sadism; their worlds do not communicate, just as the genius of those who created them - Masoch and Sade - lie stylistically, philosophically, and politically poles a part. Venus in Furs, the most famous of all of Masoch's novels was written in 1870 and belongs to an unfinished cycle of works that Masoch entitled The Heritage of Cain. The cycle was to treat a series of themes including love, war, and death. The present work is about love. Although the entire constellation of symbols that has come to characterize the masochistic syndrome can be found here - fetishes, whips, disguises, fur-clad women, contracts, humiliations, punishment, and always the volatile presence of a terrible coldness - these do not eclipse the singular power of Masoch's eroticism.",English,9780942299557,"['Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Sexuality', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Literary Criticism', 'Classics', 'Erotica', 'France']",[],Paperback,,296,Zone Books,August 5th 1991,02/01/67,[],1242,"['452', '476', '233', '63', '18']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349037274l/94654.jpg,99,1,13.90,94654.0

Little did Kathy Yorgason realize what those words would come to mean.Charity Afton Yorgason was born without a brain. She had a brain stem, but her foster parents were told she would most likely die before she was two years old. Blaine and Kathy's response was simple: ""If she needs a home, we'll be happy to give it to her""So Charity was adopted and the miracles began. This little girl quickly refuted all the medical evidence and proved she was capable of a great many things. She could smile and laugh, she could hear, she could follow people with her eyes and recognize loved ones. Regrettably, she could also obviously feel pain, and her suffering at times was almost incomprehensible.But the greatest of Charity's attributes was the love that radiated from her smile and her eyes to touch the hearts of all who knew her. She literally and permanently changed lives for the better just by being alive.This astounding true account includes all the years of Charity's life and is a stunning testimony of the power of the spirit, the love of God, and the purpose of mortality.",English,9781576360002,"['Nonfiction', 'Lds', 'Religion', 'Biography', 'Adoption', 'Memoir', 'Inspirational', 'Adult', 'Lds Fiction', 'Biography Memoir']",[],,,130,Gentle Breeze,1995,,[],932,"['475', '290', '131', '34', '2']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1313438333l/1154601.jpg,94,1,9.94,1154601.0

123843.Essays_and_Lectures,Essays and Lectures,,"Ralph Waldo Emerson, Joel Porte (Editor)",4.31,"This first Library of America volume of Emerson’s writing covers the most productive period of his life, 1832–1860. Our most eloquent champion of individualism, Emerson acknowledges at the same time the countervailing pressures of society in American life. Even as he extols what he called “the great and crescive self,” he dramatizes and records its vicissitudes.Here are the indispensable and most renowned works, including “The American Scholar” (“our intellectual Declaration of Independence,” as Oliver Wendell Holmes called it), “The Divinity School Address,” considered atheistic by many of his listeners, the summons to “Self-Reliance,” along with the more embattled realizations of “Circles” and, especially, “Experience.” Here, too, are his wide-ranging portraits of Montaigne, Shakespeare, and other “representative men,” and his astute observations on the habits, lives, and prospects of the English and American people.This volume includes Emerson’s well-known Nature; Addresses, and Lectures (1849), his Essays: First Series (1841) and Essays: Second Series (1844), plus Representative Men (1850), English Traits (1856), and his later book of essays, The Conduct of Life (1860). These are the works that established Emerson’s colossal reputation in America and found him admirers abroad as diverse as Carlyle, Nietzsche, and Proust.Emerson’s enduring power is apparent everywhere in American literature: in those, like Whitman and some of the major twentieth-century poets, who seek to corroborate his vision, and among those, like Hawthorne and Melville, who questioned, qualified, and struggled with it. Emerson’s vision reverberates also in the tradition of American philosophy, notably in the writings of William James and John Dewey, in the works of his European admirers, such as Nietzsche, and in the avant-garde theorists of our own day who write on the nature and function of language. The reasons for Emerson’s durability will be obvious to any reader who follows the exhilarating, exploratory movements of his mind in this uniquely full gathering of his work.Not merely another selection of his essays, this volume includes all his major books in their rich entirety. No other volume conveys so comprehensively the exhilaration and exploratory energy of perhaps America’s greatest writer.",English,9780940450158,"['Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'American', '19th Century', 'History', 'Poetry', 'Politics']",[],Hardcover,,1150,Library of America,November 15th 1983,,[],2814,"['1500', '813', '398', '77', '26']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309198757l/123843.jpg,371,5,13.16,123843.0
18782487-the-quran-and-modern-science,The Quran and Modern Science,,Zakir Naik,4.43,"Ever since the dawn of human life on this planet, Man has always sought to understand Nature, his own place in the scheme of Creation and the purpose of Life itself. In this quest for Truth, spanning many centuries and diverse civilizations, organized religion has shaped human life and determined to a large extent, the course of history. While some religions have been based on books, claimed by their adherents to be divinely inspired, others have relied solely on human experience. Al-Qur'an, the main source of the Islamic faith, is a book believed by Muslims, to be of completely Divine origin. Muslims also believe that it contains Divine guidance for all humankind. Since the message of the Qur'an is believed to be for all times, it should be relevant to every age. Does the Qur'an pass this test? In this booklet, I intend to give an objective analysis of the Muslim belief regarding the Divine origin of the Qur'an, in the light of established scientific discoveries. There was a time, in the history of world civilization, when 'miracles', or what was perceived to be a miracle, took precedence over human reason and logic. But how do we define the term 'miracle'? A miracle is anything that takes place out of the normal course of life and for which humankind has no explanation. However, we must be careful before we accept something as a miracle. An article in `The Times of India', Mumbai, in 1993 reported that 'a saint' by the name 'Baba Pilot' claimed to have stayed continuously submerged under water in a tank for three consecutive days and nights. However, when reporters wanted to examine the base of the tank of water where he claimed to have performed this 'miraculous' feat, he refused to let them do so. He argued by asking as to how one could examine the womb of a mother that gives birth to a child. The `Baba' was hiding something. It as a gimmick simply to gain publicity. Surely, no modern man with even the slightest inkling towards rational thinking would accept such a 'miracle'. If such false miracles are the tests of divinity, then we would have to accept Mr. P.C. Sorcar, the world famous magician known for his ingenious magical tricks and illusions, as the best god-man. A book, claiming Divine origin, is in effect, claiming to be a miracle. Such a claim should be easily verifiable in any age, according to the standards of that age. Muslims believe, that the Qur'an is the last and final revelation of God, the miracle of miracles revealed as a mercy to humankind. This book Quran and Modern Science will investigate the veracity of this belief written by great scholar Dr. Zakir Naik.",English,9999999999999,"['Islam', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Philosophy']",[],,,44,Darussalam Publishers,December 15th 2013,01/05/01,[],745,"['532', '101', '49', '27', '36']",92.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1395051338l/18782487.jpg,75,1,,18782487.0

Banger, President of the Insurgents MC, isn’t looking for a woman to replace his beloved wife. Ever since she died, he’s closed his heart to loving again. He satisfies his carnal pleasure with the club girls and hoodrats. It’s safer that way.  The President of the national club may have sparkling blue eyes and an infectious smile, but make no mistake, if someone crosses him or his club, he’d slit their throat in a heartbeat.  Set in his ways, tough, tattooed, and a no BS-type of man, Banger is doing just fine until he meets the sassy, curly-haired, single mom who can cook the best fried chicken he’s ever tasted.  He can’t get enough of her cooking… or her.  For the first time since he’s been widowed, he wants a woman in his life warming his bed.  And the no-nonsense woman, who has a body made for sinning, has turned his world upside down.  Belle Dermot is a widow with two kids whose husband left her penniless. Wanting a fresh start, she moves to Pinewood Springs and takes a job at the local diner cooking tasty, home-cooked meals.  After finding out her husband was a cheating louse, the last thing she wants is another man in her life. She has her hands full with a rebellious teenage daughter, paying the bills, and fending off nasty accusations that she poisoned her husband.  Then she meets Banger, the muscular, handsome, and rugged biker who comes crashing into her life. If only he wasn’t so nice to her and didn’t get her all hot and bothered. And why did he have to be so damn good in bed?  As hard as she tries to push him away, he keeps slipping back into her life, helping her with her problems. And Banger’s not the type to let go once he decides on something. And he’s decided to make Belle his. Now, he just needs her to agree to be his woman…  The Insurgents MC series are standalone romance novels. This is Banger and Belle’s love story.

20697435-the-book-of-strange-new-things,The Book of Strange New Things,,Michel Faber,3.66,"A monumental, genre-defying novel over ten years in the making, Michel Faber's The Book of Strange New Things is a masterwork from a writer in full command of his many talents.It begins with Peter, a devoted man of faith, as he is called to the mission of a lifetime, one that takes him galaxies away from his wife, Bea. Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter's teachings—his Bible is their ""book of strange new things."" But Peter is rattled when Bea's letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling. Bea's faith, once the guiding light of their lives, begins to falter. Suddenly, a separation measured by an otherworldly distance, and defined both by one newly discovered world and another in a state of collapse, is threatened by an ever-widening gulf that is much less quantifiable. While Peter is reconciling the needs of his congregation with the desires of his strange employer, Bea is struggling for survival. Their trials lay bare a profound meditation on faith, love tested beyond endurance, and our responsibility to those closest to us. Marked by the same bravura storytelling and precise language that made The Crimson Petal and the White such an international success, The Book of Strange New Things is extraordinary, mesmerizing, and replete with emotional complexity and genuine pathos.",English,9780553418842,"['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fantasy', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Adult Fiction']","['Peter Leigh', 'Beatrice Leigh', 'Jesus Lover Five', 'Grainger']",Hardcover,,500,Hogarth,October 28th 2014,10/06/14,"['Arthur C.

Then came 'Tis, his glorious account of his early years in New York.Now, here at last, is McCourt's long-awaited book about how his thirty-year teaching career shaped his second act as a writer. Teacher Man is also an urgent tribute to teachers everywhere. In bold and spirited prose featuring his irreverent wit and heartbreaking honesty, McCourt records the trials, triumphs and surprises he faces in public high schools around New York City. His methods anything but conventional, McCourt creates a lasting impact on his students through imaginative assignments (he instructs one class to write ""An Excuse Note from Adam or Eve to God""), singalongs (featuring recipe ingredients as lyrics), and field trips (imagine taking twenty-nine rowdy girls to a movie in Times Square!).McCourt struggles to find his way in the classroom and spends his evenings drinking with writers and dreaming of one day putting his own story to paper. Teacher Man shows McCourt developing his unparalleled ability to tell a great story as, five days a week, five periods per day, he works to gain the attention and respect of unruly, hormonally charged or indifferent adolescents.

In it, Bloom, whose magnificent translation of Plato's Republic has been universally hailed as a virtual rediscovery of that timeless text, again brings together the translator's gift for journeying between two languages and cultures and the philosopher's perception of the true meaning and significance of the issues being examined in the work. The result is a clear, readable, and highly engrossing text that at the same time offers a wholly new sense of the importance and relevance of Rousseau's thought to us.In addition to his translation, Bloom provides a brilliant introduction that relates the structure and themes of the book to the vital preoccupation's of our own age, particularly in the field of education, but also more generally to the current concerns about the limits and possibilities of human nature. Thus in this translation Emile, long a classic in the history of Western thought and educational theory, becomes something more: a prescription, fresh and dazzling, for the bringing up of autonomous, responsible—that is, truly democratic—human beings.",English,9780465019311,"['Philosophy', 'Education', 'Classics', 'Nonfiction', 'France', '18th Century', 'French Literature', 'History', 'Politics', 'Literature']",[],Paperback,,512,Basic Books,June 29th 1979,10/30/62,[],3876,"['981', '1212', '1088', '439', '156']",85.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334836441l/326679.jpg,100,1,3.13,326679.0

Het vertelt over een jonge vrouw die voorbestemd is de bruid van de koning van Ulster te worden, maar die het land ontvlucht met de minnaar die ze zelf gekozen heeft. De jaloezie van de koning lokt verraad en wraak uit, wat leidt tot de noodlottige afloop die al bij Deirdres geboorte was voorspeld.

Yet in The Science of Interstellar, Kip Thorne, the physicist who assisted Nolan on the scientific aspects of Interstellar, shows us that the movie’s jaw-dropping events and stunning, never-before-attempted visuals are grounded in real science. Thorne shares his experiences working as the science adviser on the film and then moves on to the science itself. In chapters on wormholes, black holes, interstellar travel, and much more, Thorne’s scientific insights—many of them triggered during the actual scripting and shooting of Interstellar—describe the physical laws that govern our universe and the truly astounding phenomena that those laws make possible.Interstellar and all related characters and elements are trademarks of and © Warner Bros.

Written more than two thousand years ago, the Tao Teh Ching, or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the Tao Teh Ching teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual.

Growing up in the shadow of Cape Canaveral, young Dolores Gray has it particularly bad: she dreams of becoming an astronaut.At school, Dolores finds herself caught between her desire for popularity and her secret friendship with the smartest and most unpopular boy in her class, whose father is NASA's Director of Launch Safety. At home, discord begins to grow between her parents when her father's job as a NASA technician is threatened.Looking for escape, Dolores loses herself in her scrapbook, where she files away newspaper articles about the astronauts and the shuttles, weather reports on launch scrubs, and stories about her idol, Judith Resnik.Then, on the morning of January 28, 1986, seventy-three seconds after liftoff, the space shuttle ""Challenger"" explodes, killing all seven astronauts on board -- including Judith Resnik. It is a moment that shakes America to its core, and nowhere is it more deeply felt than in central Florida. Dolores becomes determined to reconstruct what went wrong, both in her parent's marriage and at NASA, in the hope that she can save her father's job and keep her family together.""The Time It Takes to Fall"" is a coming-of-age novel that deftly weaves the story of one family's drama into the larger picture of a touchstone event in American history. It is at once an intimate look at a young girl's loss of innocence and a portrait of America's loss of innocence -- the end of an era that romanticized manned space flight and would never be the same again.",English,9780743297226,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Coming Of Age', 'Space', 'Novels', 'Own', 'Adult Fiction']",[],Hardcover,,320,Simon & Schuster,February 6th 2007,10/30/07,[],355,"['84', '151', '96', '20', '4']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1175729885l/551925.jpg,98,1,5.44,551925.0

Born into slavery in 1797, Truth fled from bondage some 30 years later to become a powerful figure in the progressive movements reshaping American society.This remarkable narrative, first published in 1850, offers a rare glimpse into the little-documented world of Northern slavery. Truth recounts her life as a slave in rural New York, her separation from her family, her religious conversion, and her life as a traveling preacher during the 1840s. She also describes her work as a social reformer, counselor of former slaves, and sponsor of a black migration to the West.A spellbinding orator and implacable prophet, Truth mesmerized audiences with her tales of life in bondage and with her moving renditions of Methodist hymns and her own songs. Frederick Douglass described her message as a ""strange compound of wit and wisdom, of wild enthusiasm, and flint-like common sense."" This inspiring account of a black woman's struggles for racial and sexual equality is essential reading for students of American history, as well as for those interested in the continuing quest for equality of opportunity.",,9780486298993,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'African American', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'American History']",['Sojourner Truth'],Kindle Edition,,,,,10/30/50,[],8534,"['3771', '2664', '1588', '384', '127']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328343279l/11637339.jpg,96,1,4.83,11637339.0

His Tunisian water-colours depicting landscape, architecture and, above all, the North African light of this Mediterranean land constitute the true beginning of Klee's painting career. Although these paintings still fall under the heading of ""objective"", they already exhibit indications of his tendency toward abstraction and a language of forms. Geometrical figures and hieroglyphic elements characterize the majority of these works, which for this reason seem reminiscent of ""naive"" and playful children's painting.

676723.Obedience_to_Authority,Obedience to Authority,,Stanley Milgram,4.2,"Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to. Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others. Obedience, as a determinant of behavior is of particular relevance to our time. It has been reliably established that from 1933 to 1945 millions of innocent people were systematically slaughtered on command. Gas chambers were built, death camps were guarded, daily quotas of corpses were produced with the same efficiency as the manufacture of appliances. These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person, but they could only have been carried out on a massive scale if a very large number of people obeyed orders.Obedience is the psychological mechanism that links individual action to political purpose. It is the dispositional cement that binds men to systems of authority. Facts of recent history and observation in daily life suggest that for many people obedience may be a deeply ingrained behavior tendency, indeed, a prepotent impulse overriding training in ethics, sympathy, and moral conduct. C. P. Snow (1961) points to its importance when he writes:When you think of the long and gloomy history of man, you will find more hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obedience than have ever been committed in the name of rebellion. If you doubt that, read William Sbirer's 'Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.' The German Officer Corps were brought up in the most rigorous code of obedience . . . in the name of obedience they were party to, andassisted in, the most wicked large scale actions in the history of the world. (p. 24)The Nazi extermination of European Jews is the most extremeinstance of abhorrent immoral acts carried out by thousands ofpeople in the name of obedience. Yet in lesser degree this type ofthing is constantly recurring: ordinary citizens are ordered todestroy other people, and they do so because they consider ittheir duty to obey orders. Thus, obedience to authority, longpraised as a virtue, takes on a new aspect when it serves amalevolent cause; far from appearing as a virtue, it is transformedinto a heinous sin. Or is it?The moral question of whether one should obey when commands conflict with conscience was argued by Plato, dramatized in ""Antigone,"" and treated to philosophic analysis in every historical epoch Conservative philosophers argue that the very fabric of society is threatened by disobedience, and even when the act prescribed by an authority is an evil one, it is better to carry out the act than to wrench at the structure of authority. Hobbes stated further that an act so executed is in no sense the responsibility of the person who carries it out but only of the authority that orders it. But humanists argue for the primacy of individual conscience in such matters, insisting that the moral judgments of the individual must override authority when the two are in conflict.The legal and philosophic aspects of obedience are of enormous import, but an empirically grounded scientist eventually comes to the point where he wishes to move from abstract discourse to the careful observation of concrete instances. In order to take a close look at the act of obeying, I set up a simple experimentat Yale University. Eventually, the experiment was to involve more than a thousand participants and would be repeated at several universities, but at the beginning, the conception was simple. A person comes to a psychological laboratory and is told to carry out a series of acts that come increasingly into conflict with conscience. The main question is how far the participant will comply with the experimenter's instructions before refusing to carry out the actions required of him.But the reader needs to know a little more detail about the experiment. Two people come to a psychology laboratory to take part in a study of memory and learning. One of them is designated as a ""teacher"" and the other a ""learner."" The experimenter explains that the study is concerned with the effects of punishment on learning. The learner is conducted into a room, seated in a chair, his arms strapped to prevent excessive movement, and an electrode attached to his wrist. He is told that he is to learn a list of word pairs; whenever he makes an error, be will receive electric shocks of increasing intensity.The real focus of the experiment is the teacher. After watching the learner being strapped into place, he is taken into the main experimental room and seated before an impressive shock generator. Its main feature is a horizontal line of thirty switches, ranging from 15 volts to 450 volts, in 15-volt increments. There are also verbal designations which range from Slight SHOCK to Danger--Severe SHOCK. The teacher is told that he is to administer the learning test to the man in the other room. When the learner responds correctly, the teacher moves on to the next item; when the other man gives an incorrectanswer, the teacher is to give him an electric shock. He is to start at the lowest shock level ( 15 volts) and to increase the level each time the man makes an error, going through 30 volts, 45 volts, and so on.The ""teacher"" is a genuinely naive subject who has come to the laboratory to participate in an experiment. The learner, or victim, is an actor who actually receives no shock at all. The point of the experiment is to see how far a person will proceed in a concrete and measurable situation in which he is ordered to inflict increasing pain on a protesting victim.",English,9780061319839,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Social Science', 'Politics', 'History', 'Research', 'Classics']",[],Paperback,,256,Harper Perennial,August 8th 1983,10/30/74,['National Book Award Finalist for The Sciences (1975)'],3491,"['1573', '1226', '554', '103', '35']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403550976l/676723.jpg,154,2,6.08,676723.0

Where his later works carry these drives to inevitably dramatic conclusions, The Insulted & Injured confines them within the smaller boundaries of everyday event. In this story the impulse toward self-abnegation in love, which appears so markedly in both Vanya & Natasha, isn't itself enough to direct their lives; instead, it combines with their social world & the mundane ambitions of Prince Valkovsky to defeat their hope of happiness. Of all the characters in the novel, only Natasha's lover, the Prince's son Alyosha-the person least driven to mold life to his own terms-emerges untouched. Here are, to a greater extent than in Dostoevsky's more familiar works, flesh-&-blood people as we see them around every day. They are made up of both good & evil, of will & acceptance.

Neff (Goodreads Author),4.11,"The Tapestry series continues to weave threads of fantasy, mythology, science fiction, and mystery into a wholly original adventure that appeals to fans of everything from Harry Potter to Lord of the Rings to The X-Men. Genre-blending and fully illustrated, The Tapestry novels have caught the attention of middle-grade and young adult readers alike—and the series is only getting bigger.Book One, The Hound of Rowan, was a boarding-school fantasy that School Library Journal called “a solid and worthwhile beginning . . . [that] should help ease the suffering once Harry Potter withdrawal sets in.” Book Two, The Second Siege, was an epic quest about which Kirkus Reviews said, “After devouring this title, young fans will clamor for more.”Book Three, The Fiend and the Forge, is an unforgettable dystopian adventure across a landscape overrun with goblins and trolls. The world has changed almost beyond recognition, for with the Book of Origins firmly in his possession, the villainous Astaroth now has the power to reshape history at will. Plucking pivotal discoveries from mankind’s past, he has reduced the world to a preindustrial nightmare.But while most humans toil as slaves within four demonic kingdoms, Astaroth allows those at Rowan to thrive in peaceful isolation. Theirs is a land where magic and nature flourish . . . so long as none dare oppose the new order.That proves too steep a price for Max McDaniels. Unsure of his place at Rowan, Max sets out to explore the shifting landscape of the world beyond. In the course of his travels, he will become many things: Prisoner. Gladiator. Assassin. But can he become the hero that mankind so desperately needs?In the third book of The Tapestry, author–illustrator Henry H.

Yabancı işte ilk bu fireyi vermeyi öğrenir. Yabancı bir ülkede yaşamının birinci icabı insanın en aşina olduğu şeye, ismine yabancılaşmasıdır.(Arka Kapak)""Ne hoş tesadüf,"" dedi Debra zoraki bir neşeyle, ""çok sevindim. Ne kadar iyi bir ahçı olduğunu biliyorum."" Değişik bir hali vardı, okuma grubundakinden çok daha kendine güvenli görünüyordu. ""Senin için bir sakıncası yoksa çalışmaya hemen başlayalım, zaman geçiyor ve hiçbir şey hazır değil.""Alegre'yi soktuğu çivit mavisi mutfak duvardan duvara paketler, kutular, konserve kutuları ve kavanozlarla doluydu, gıda, gıda, gıda. Misafirlerin yediden sonra gelecekleri ve büyük olasılıkla sekiz buçuk civarında kurt gibi acıkacakları söylendi. Toplam yirmi iki kişi bekleniyordu. ""Biz de iki kişiyiz. Doyuracak yirmi dört boğaz eder. Ne dersin? Başarabilir miyiz?""Ama çok geçmeden ortaya çıkacağı üzre ""biz"" diye bir şey yoktu. Sadece Alegre vardı. Kendi ahçılık tarihinde bu kadar kısa sürede, bu kadar çok insan için bu kadar çok yemek pişirdiği olmamıştı hiç. Yine de yiyecek konusunda kendisine böyle muhtaç olunması sinirlerini yatıştırmış olacaktı çünkü kendini bu işin altından kalkmaya tamamen muktedir hissediyordu. O malzemeleri incelerken Debra Ellen Thompson da onu inceleyecek vakit buldu. Alegre'nin değişik bir hali vardı şimdi, okuma grubunda olduğundan daha az ürkekti.Gerçekten de kendinden emindi Alegre, hatta Debra nihayet mutfak kapısının öteki tarafındaki sürekli mızıldanan kadın sesinin yardımına koşup onu mutfakta yalnız bıraktığında kendine güveni iyice artacaktı; dışarıdan gelen sese bakılırsa biri oturma odasını akşam için derleyip toplamaya çalışıyor ama aslında bu işi yapmak istemiyordu, hem de hiç. Alegre mutfakta tek başına kalınca oturma odasında olanları hiç merak etmedi, tıpkı evin geri kalanıyla ya da misafirlerin nasıl insanlar olduklarıyla ilgilenmediği gibi. O olmak istediği yerdeydi: mutfakta. Başka birine ait olsa da onun mutfağıydı burası artık. Tek bilmek istediği tam olarak ne pişirmesinin istendiğiydi. Ama kimse bu konuyu açıklığa kavuşturmak için gelmedi. Onun yerine içeri komik, basık burunlu, aşırı uzun tüylü, duman grisi tombul bir kedi girdi ihtişamla, hemen onun arkasından da ne işler karıştırdığını anlamak için yine aynı türden, tekir ve belki daha az mağrur bir başka kedi geldi. Evsahiplerinin ona nasıl bir menü istedikleri konusunda ipucu verecek kadar sorumlu davranmasını beklemekten ve kedileri seyretmekten sıkılan Alegre bu yiyecek gemisinin tek kaptanının kendisi olduğuna ve karar vermenin de kendisine düştüğüne kanaat getirdi. Buzdolabında bulduğu keçi peynirini pidelerin üzerine ufaladı. Dolaplarda bir sürü ton balığı konservesi buldu ve bunlardan bol bol şehriyeli ton balığı fettuccine yaptı. Buzluktaki kıyma çabucak köfteye dönüştü; tezgâhın üzerindeki lahana barbunyalı lahana salatası oldu; artık mısırların bir kısmı puding, geri kalanı mısırlı kabak sotesi halini aldı. Patatesler her zamanki gibi fazlasıyla işe yaradı. Alegre onları haşladı, kızarttı, fırınladı, ezdi, üzerlerine çeşit çeşit baharatlarla soslar döktü. Geri kalanları domuz pastırması ve peynirle doldurdu. Dolaplarda bulduğu tako soslarının hiçbirini fazla tutmasa da tavuklu burritos doldurdu. Fıstıklı banma sosu ve tavuk ciğerli börek hazırladı.

I've looked into the eyes of women who have banged nine-inch nails into the skulls of their victims with hammers ... we evaluate them, trying to determine whether they have actually changed, or whether there's still a core of evil within them...Before his diagnosis, DCI Mark Lapslie thought everyone was like him. Now he knows he suffers from synaethesthesia - a rare neurological condition that has cross-wired his senses. The sickening clamour of sounds he can taste has smothered his marriage and stifled his career. At the scene of a fatal traffic accident, Lapslie's interest isn't in the recently deceased driver, rather the desiccated corpse found lying next to him. Something about the body stirs a fleeting recollection at the back of Lapslie's mind... he can't quite put his finger on it, but he can almost taste it... Memories haunt Violet Chambers. Taking tea with her friend Daisy, she knows it's time to move on. As Daisy falls to the floor, eyes streaming, face burning, Violet calmly waits. Black hellebore is remarkably potent.

Would I be able to straighten out the errors and mistakes and save all of us? I didn't grasp the depth and weight of this question. It was true that I desperately wanted to save all of us. No one deserves to die, to despair, to be suppressed, and be despised. On top of that, they were my friends. We might've had our flaws and scars and have been twisted up and distorted. We might've been nobodies. But we were alive. We had days to live, plans to follow, and dreams to fulfill.At first, I didn't think much of it. I thought it'd all depend on how much effort I put in after I figured out who I needed to save and from what. That was what I'd thought. I believed I could solve it all by persuading them and changing things. I was that simple and naïve. But it was no more than an attempt to save my own skin. After a series of trials and errors, I had a realization. It wasn't so simple to save the others.

This time of convulsion is the subject of J. G. Farrell's The Siege of Krishnapur, widely considered one of the finest British novels of the last fifty years. Farrell's story is set in an isolated Victorian outpost on the subcontinent.

But when they find themselves under actual siege, the true character of their dominion--at once brutal, blundering, and wistful--is soon revealed. The Siege of Krishnapur is a companion to Troubles, about the Easter 1916 rebellion in Ireland, and The Singapore Grip, which takes place just before World War II, as the sun begins to set upon the British Empire.

1202.Freakonomics,Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,Freakonomics,"Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner (Goodreads Author)",3.98,"Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)",English,9780061234002,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Audiobook', 'Social Science']",[],Hardcover,Revised and Expanded Edition (US/CAN),320,William Morrow,10/17/06,04/12/05,"['Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Nonfiction (2006)', 'Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Nominee for Shortlist (2005)', 'The Quill Award for Business (2005)']",708708,"['245341', '272578', '139864', '32567', '18358']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550917827l/1202._SX318_.jpg,10521,140,8.33,1202.0

Then there’s her twin brother, Eugene, whose fear of the dark goes far beyond the things that go bump in the night. And her mother, Rosemary, is absolutely terrified of bad luck.As for Esther, she’s managed to escape the curse…so far. She doesn’t yet have a great fear because she avoids pretty much everything.

Esther thinks she has it all figured out, until she’s reunited with an old elementary school classmate—and first crush—Jonah Smallwood. The encounter leaves her stranded at a bus stop and swindled out of her phone, all her cash, a Fruit Roll-Up she’d been saving, and her list—not to mention her dignity. But the theft is also the beginning of an unexpected friendship between the two, one that sends the pair on a journey of self-discovery as they try to break the curse that’s consumed Esther’s family.

Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers might have little in common, but they all started with why. It was their natural ability to start with why that enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things.In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way—and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be lead, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.Any organization can explain what it does; some can explain how they do it; but very few can clearly articulate why. WHY is not money or profit—those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders, but not others?Starting with WHY works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to.Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire.

Part historical novel, fantasy, love story, thriller, and mystery. . . It's a must-read."" —Booklist (starred review)   A New York Times bestseller and global sensation, Angelology unfurled a brilliant tapestry of myth and biblical lore on our present-day world and plunged two star-crossed heroes into an ancient battle against mankind’s greatest enemy: the fatally attractive angel-human hybrids known as the Nephilim. With Angelopolis, the conflict deepens into an inferno of danger and passion unbound. A decade has passed since Verlaine saw Evangeline alight from the Brooklyn Bridge, the sight of her new wings a betrayal that haunts him still. Now an elite angel hunter for the Society of Angelology, he pursues his mission with single-minded devotion: to capture, imprison, and eliminate her kind. But when Evangeline suddenly appears on a twilit Paris street, Verlaine finds her nature to be unlike any of the other creatures he so mercilessly pursues, casting him into a spiral of doubt and confusion that only grows when she is abducted before his eyes by a creature who has topped the society’s most-wanted list for more than a century. The ensuing chase drives Verlaine and his fellow angelologists from the shadows of the Eiffel Tower to the palaces of St. Petersburg and deep into the provinces of Siberia and the Black Sea coast, where the truth of Evangeline’s origins—as well as forces that could restore or annihilate them all—lie in wait. Conceived against an astonishing fresh tableau of history and science, Angelopolis plumbs Russia’s imperial past, modern genetics, and ancient depictions of that most potent angelic appearance—the Annunciation of Gabriel—in a high-octane tale of abduction, treasure seeking, and divine warfare as the fate of humanity once again hangs in the balance.",English,9780670025541,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Angels', 'Paranormal', 'Thriller', 'Supernatural', 'Adult', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Mystery']",[],Hardcover,,302,Viking Adult,March 26th 2013,,[],4013,"['778', '1108', '1309', '625', '193']",80.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409336334l/16158489.jpg,91,1,4.62,16158489.0

1265524.Time_And_Eternity,Time And Eternity: Exploring God's Relationship To Time,,William Lane Craig,4.16,"Time and Eternity deals with difficult issues in modern physics and brings them into relation with traditional theological doctrines. Craig has done a great work, and it is marvelous that now the philosophy of religion is engaging with the philosophy of science to the great benefit of both.--John R. LucasFellow of Merton College, Oxford University Time and Eternity offers a comprehensive discussion of the problems in the concepts of time and eternity on the basis of an extraordinary familiarity with a vast number of recent contributions to this issue from scientists and philosophers. The argument is subtle and precise. Particularly important are the sections on the impact of the different versions of relativity theory on the concept of time.... The book offers a plausible argument for a realistic conception of temporal process and for God's involvement in the temporal distinctions and processes because of His presence in His creation.--Wolfhart PannenbergProfessor of Systematic TheologyLudwig Maximilliens Universitaet-Muenchen, Germany As a scientist doing theoretical research in gravitational physics and quantum cosmology, I found Dr. Craig's thoughtful book highly interesting. He has carefully given arguments defending several different viewpoints for each of the many issues about time that he discusses, followed by critiques in which he emphasizes his own opinion. Reading Time and Eternity has forced me to develop better arguments for my own opinions (which differ considerably from Craig's).... I am certain that Time and Eternity will also stimulate your thinking about this fascinating subject and your appreciation for the God who created time as part of the marvelous universe He has given us.--Don N. PageProfessor of Physics and Fellow of the Cosmology and Gravitation Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced ResearchUniversity of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada William Lane Craig is one the leading philosophers of religion and one of the leading philosophers of time. In this book, he combines his expertise in these areas to produce an original, erudite, and accessible theory of time and God that will be of great interest to both the general public and scholars. It is a rewarding experience to read through this brilliant and well-researched book by one of the most learned and creative thinkers of our era.--Quentin SmithProfessor of Philosophy, Western Michigan University In Time and Eternity, William Lane Craig defends the remarkable conclusion that ""God is timeless without creation and temporal since creation."" Craig argues his case philosophically by carefully weighing evidence for and against divine temporality and personhood in light of dynamic versus static theories of time and their warrants, in turn, in a Lorentzian interpretation of special relativity and an objective, mind-independent theory of becoming, including fascinating excursions into Big Bang cosmology and the philosophy of mathematics. As the latest in his series of ground-breaking books, Time and Eternity summarizes and extends Craig's previous technical arguments and conveys them to a more general audience. It is a must-read for anyone seriously interested in the problem of time and eternity in Christian philosophy.--Robert RussellProfessor of Theology and ScienceGraduate Theological Union, Berkeley, Calif. The nature of time is a continuing source of puzzlement both to science and in everyday life. It is also an important issue in theological understandings of the nature of God. In this interesting book, Professor Craig tackles this complex set of topics in a clear way. His discussion of the interrelated scientific, philosophical, and theological issues clears up many previous misconceptions and proposes a plausible understanding of the relation of God to time and eternity that many will find helpful.--George EllisProfessor of Mathematics and Applied MathematicsUniversity of Capetown",English,9781581342413,"['Philosophy', 'Theology', 'Science', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Faith']",[],Paperback,,274,Crossway,2001,,[],262,"['110', '100', '38', '11', '3']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369824398l/1265524.jpg,191,2,15.09,1265524.0

42607.As_You_Like_It,As You Like It,,William Shakespeare,3.83,"Readers and audiences have long greeted As You Like It with delight. Its characters are brilliant conversationalists, including the princesses Rosalind and Celia and their Fool, Touchstone. Soon after Rosalind and Orlando meet and fall in love, the princesses and Touchstone go into exile in the Forest of Arden, where they find new conversational partners. Duke Frederick, younger brother to Duke Senior, has overthrown his brother and forced him to live homeless in the forest with his courtiers, including the cynical Jaques. Orlando, whose older brother Oliver plotted his death, has fled there, too.Recent scholars have also grounded the play in the issues of its time. These include primogeniture, passing property from a father to his oldest son. As You Like It depicts intense conflict between brothers, exposing the human suffering that primogeniture entails. Another perspective concerns cross-dressing. Most of Orlando’s courtship of Rosalind takes place while Rosalind is disguised as a man, “Ganymede.” At her urging, Orlando pretends that Ganymede is his beloved Rosalind. But as the epilogue reveals, the sixteenth-century actor playing Rosalind was male, following the practice of the time.

Souza was with President Obama more often, and at more crucial moments, than any friend or staff member, or even the First Lady--and he photographed it all. Souza captured nearly 2 million photographs of Obama, in moments ranging from classified to disarmingly candid.This large-format (12""x10""), exquisitely produced book presents more than 300 of Souza's favorite and most iconic images from these historic years; many have never been seen before. This seminal work on the Obama presidency documents moments of national importance--including the historic image of the President and his advisors watching tensely in the Situation Room as the Bin Laden mission unfolded--alongside unguarded moments with the President's family, his many encounters with children, and his time spent interacting with world leaders, members of Congress, White House staff, artists, musicians and more.The photographs are paired with captions and stories providing behind-the-scenes context for each, and offer insight into the special relationship Souza and the President forged during their time together. The result is a stunning record of a landmark era in American history.Souza's work enabled us to feel that we knew the President.

For women who want an alternative, choice is often unavailable: Midwives are sometimes inaccessible; in eleven states they are illegal. In one of those states, even birthing centers are outlawed.When did birth become an emergency instead of an emergence? Since when is normal, physiological birth a crime?

Against this backdrop, Block investigates whether routine C-sections, inductions, and epidurals equal medical progress. She examines childbirth as a reproductive rights issue: Do women have the right to an optimal birth experience? If so, is that right being upheld? Block's research and experience reveal in vivid detail that while emergency obstetric care is essential, there is compelling evidence that we are overusing medical technology at the expense of maternal and infant health: Either women's bodies are failing, or the system is failing women.",English,9780738210735,"['Nonfiction', 'Parenting', 'Health', 'Feminism', 'Medicine', 'Science', 'Medical', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Womens']",[],Hardcover,,316,Da Capo Press,June 4th 2007,06/01/07,[],2652,"['1262', '915', '349', '77', '49']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438294064l/607901._SY475_.jpg,77,1,5.58,607901.0

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.

Airships soar in the skies over the city, whilst ground trains rumble through the streets and clockwork automatons are programmed to carry out menial tasks in the offices of lawyers, policemen and journalists.

It's a world in which she can escape some of her more painful childhood realities, like those games her father likes to make her play, where he's the boss and she the naughty secretary. And her mother so fiercely favors her younger brother, the cherubic Willy, that Thelma finds herself perpetually in emotional exile. No wonder Thelma asks practically every adult she meets to adopt her. Along Thelma's bumpy way from a rural English village to Canada to a law degree at Oxford, she meets many potential parents and even makes some friends, but it is with the companions of her fertile imagination—with the scaredy-baby Janawee, moody and timid Ginniger, and big, strong, stoic Heroin—that Thelma finds comfort. With them, too, she loses an already tenuous connection to reality, though ultimately Thelma's spirit and humor prove to be as indomitable as her wit. ""Moving and comic at once....

1057231.Samskara,Samskara: A Rite for a Dead Man,,"U.R. Ananthamurthy, A.K. Ramanujan (Translator)",3.89,"Made into a powerful, award-winning film in 1970, this important Kannada novel of the sixties has received widespread acclaim from both critics and general readers since its first publication in 1965. As a religious novel about a decaying brahmin colony in the south Indian village of Karnataka, Samskara serves as an allegory rich in realistic detail, a contemporary reworking of ancient Hindu themes and myths, and a serious, poetic study of a religious man living in a community of priests gone to seed.

A tribe of Native Americans had made her their weroanza—a word that meant ""big chief"". The news was received with great joy, both by the Queen and her favorite, Sir Walter Ralegh. His first American expedition had brought back a captive, Manteo, who caused a sensation in Elizabethan London. In 1587, Manteo was returned to his homeland as Lord and Governor, with more than one hundred English men, women, and children. In 1590, a supply ship arrived at the colony to discover that the settlers had vanished.For almost twenty years the fate of Ralegh's colonists was to remain a mystery. When a new wave of settlers sailed to America to found Jamestown, their efforts to locate the lost colony were frustrated by the mighty chieftain, Powhatan, father of , who vowed to drive the English out of America. Only when it was too late did the settlers discover the incredible news that Ralegh's colonists had survived in the forests for almost two decades before being slaughtered in cold blood by henchmen. While Sir Walter Ralegh's ""savage"" had played a pivotal role in establishing the first English settlement in America, he had also unwittingly contributed to one of the earliest chapters in the decimation of the Native American population. The mystery of what happened to these colonists who seemed to vanish without a trace lies at the heart of this well-researched work of narrative history.",English,9780374265014,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Biography', 'The United States Of America', 'Tudor Period', 'Historical', 'Adventure', '16th Century', 'British Literature']","['John Smith, explorer', 'Pocahontas']",Hardcover,,358,Farrar Straus Giroux,November 1st 2000,11/05/00,[],839,"['249', '360', '195', '30', '5']",96.0,"['Jamestown, Virginia (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311984369l/518853.jpg,94,1,8.67,518853.0

Beautiful, eccentric, and tempestuous, Dina carries a terrible burden: at the age of five she accidentally causes her mother's death. Blamed by her father and banished to a farm, she grows up untamed and untaught. Nobody leads the child through her grief, and the accident remains a gruesome riddle of death. Her guilt becomes her obsession: her unforgiving mother haunts her every day.After several years of exile, and at the insistence of the local pastor, her father takes Dina back. By now she has become like a wolf cub. Her father has remarried, to a younger woman whom she detests, and a strict discipline begins. A tutor is brought in; coarse language is replaced by polite conversation, climbing to the top of the trees by music. But the efforts have little effect. Private and closely guarded, Dina nonetheless is able to manipulate those around her, while her unconventional behavior and erotic power both enchant and ensnare.At sixteen Dina is married off to wealthy fifty-year-old landowner Jacob, a friend of her father who has fallen completely under her spell. Jacob dies under mysterious circumstances, and Dina becomes mute. When finally she emerges from her trauma, she runs Jacob's estate with an iron hand. But still Dina wrestles with her two unappeased ghosts: Jacob and her mother.

Even during her state-mandated schooling through the eighth grade, she would dreamily fantasize about whether any of the other Amish boys in the history class right after lunch was going to be the father of her children, or if she would meet the man of her dreams from another state, an exciting possibility. But the wreck that killed her father and almost killed Ava, that early Sunday morning, at the hands of an all-night reveler, changed everything. The young man in military fatigues that pulled her to safety spoke Pennsylvania Dutch to her, but he wasn’t Amish. Or was he? And how could she be so powerfully attracted to a young man about to go overseas to war, something she fiercely believed was wrong? Roger Rheinheimer spent the first eighteen years of his life in northern Indiana. His father was the only doctor for a small town of 1200, and had a hitching rail on a side street by his office for the Amish patients. His father bought an eighty acre farm, and Roger and his older brother worked it, raising cattle and growing crops. While he was still in high school, Roger learned woodworking skills from Elmer Schlabach, his Amish mentor. They built houses in the old-fashioned tradition, from hand-mixing the concrete for the foundations to hand-nailing the shingles. The only phase they did not do was the electrical. To this day, Roger enjoys using his wood crafting skills, making acoustic guitars and furniture. Roger earned an undergraduate degree in Behavioral Psychology from a small private college in the Shenandoah Valley, took a Creative Writing class, loved it, and published a short story called My Brother. He was a regular contributing writer to the college newspaper. Roger has two novels in print and ebook, Amish Snow and Yield Spread: a novel.

And though they face all kinds of dangers in a landscape that is at times breathtakingly beautiful, at others brutal, they’re committed to their job: bringing books to people who have never had any, arming them with facts that will change their lives.Based on a true story rooted in America’s past, The Giver of Stars is unparalleled in its scope and epic in its storytelling. Funny, heartbreaking, enthralling, it is destined to become a modern classic–a richly rewarding novel of women’s friendship, of true love, and of what happens when we reach beyond our grasp for the great beyond.",English,9780399562488,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Books About Books', 'Chick Lit']","['Alice, Margery, Sophia, Izzy, Beth, Bennett, Fred, Sven']",Hardcover,,388,Pamela Dorman Books,October 8th 2019,10/03/19,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2019)'],183231,"['83114', '74275', '21046', '3460', '1336']",97.0,"['Baileyville, Kentucky (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572879113l/43925876._SX318_.jpg,97,1,16.10,43925876.0

Little did he know, as he kissed her good-bye, that he would spend the next three months in Iran’s most notorious prison, enduring brutal interrogation sessions at the hands of a man he knew only by his smell: Rosewater.For the Bahari family, wars, coups, and revolutions are not distant concepts but intimate realities they have suffered for generations: Maziar’s father was imprisoned by the shah in the 1950s, and his sister by Ayatollah Khomeini in the 1980s. Alone in his cell at Evin Prison, fearing the worst, Maziar draws strength from his memories of the courage of his father and sister in the face of torture, and hears their voices speaking to him across the years. He dreams of being with Paola in London, and imagines all that she and his rambunctious, resilient eighty-four-year-old mother must be doing to campaign for his release. During the worst of his encounters with Rosewater, he silently repeats the names of his loved ones, calling on their strength and love to protect him and praying he will be released in time for the birth of his first child.A riveting, heart-wrenching memoir, Then They Came for Me offers insight into the past seventy years of regime change in Iran, as well as the future of a country where the democratic impulses of the youth continually clash with a government that becomes more totalitarian with each passing day. An intimate and fascinating account of contemporary Iran, it is also the moving and wonderfully written story of one family’s extraordinary courage in the face of repression.",English,9781400069460,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'History', 'Politics', 'Iran', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Journalism', 'Audiobook']",[],Hardcover,,384,Random House,June 7th 2011,,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2011)'],4209,"['1528', '1823', '684', '109', '65']",96.0,['Tehran (Iran)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320560137l/11500827.jpg,98,1,5.75,11500827.0

Illustrated.  The life of Mr. Badman forms a third part to The Pilgrim’s Progress, but it is not a delightful pilgrimage to heaven. On the contrary, it is a wretched downward journey to the infernal realms. The author’s goal is to warn poor, thoughtless sinners, not with smooth words they can ignore, but with words that thunder against their consciences regarding the danger of their souls and the increasing wretchedness into which they are madly hurrying. The one who is in imminent but unseen danger will bless the warning voice if it reaches his ears, however rough and startling it sounds.  The life of Badman was written in an age when abandonment of moral principles, vice, gluttony, intemperance, habitual lewdness, and the excessive unlawful indulgence of lust marched like a ravaging army through our land, headed by the king, along with officers from his polluted peers. Are we not seeing the same thing, in every way? It is as if this book was written for us who are alive today.  About the Author John Bunyan was born in November 1628, in Elstow, England. A celebrated English minister and preacher, he wrote The Pilgrim’s Progress (1678), the book that was the most characteristic expression of the Puritan religious outlook. His other works include doctrinal and controversial writings; a spiritual autobiography, Grace Abounding (1666); and the allegory, The Holy War (1682).

I was a whore in my youth, a killer since my adolescence, and a monster as a man. I am the man who kidnapped Livvie. I am the man who held her in a dark room for weeks. But, most importantly, I am the man she loves. She loves me. It's quite sick, isn't it?

She refuses to set her beloved husband free to marry the queen; but she cannot prevent him from becoming the favorite and the focus of the feverishly plotting, pleasure seeking court.Others too oppose the marriage, but for very different reasons. William Cecil, the queen's wisest counselor, knows she must marry for policy; her uncle hates Dudley and swears he will be murder him first. Behind the triangle of lovers, the factions take up their places: the Protestants, the priests, the assassins, the diplomats and the moneymakers. The very coin of England is shaved and clipped to nothing as Elizabeth uncertainly leads her bankrupt country into a war that no-one thinks can be won.Then someone acts in secret, and for Elizabeth, Dudley and the emerging kingdom, nothing will be as planned.Blending historical fact with contemporary rumor, Philippa Gregory has created a dark and tense novel of Tudor times, which casts Elizabeth I in a light no one has suggested before.

Instead, Emily finds herself drifting, grieving her recent miscarriage and her own perceived lack of ambition, while David works in the city. Until the day Emily discovers that their new property includes an unexpected guest. Living undetected in one of the cabins is a magnetic twenty-two-year-old named Stella. Their immediate and intense connection expands and contracts over the course of an single summer, calling all of Emily’s relationships, including her marriage, into closer scrutiny.As the two women begin spending time together―talking and drinking, swimming in the lake, watching seductive French films through long afternoons―Emily finds herself playing at performing various roles relative to Stella: friend, mother, lover. Each encounter they share promises to bring Emily a little closer to an understanding of her own identity, but it also puts her marriage and future at risk.

10252302-blue-nights,Blue Nights,,Joan Didion,3.83,"From one of our most powerful writers, a work of stunning frankness about losing a daughter. Richly textured with bits of her own childhood and married life with her husband, John Gregory Dunne, and daughter, Quintana Roo, this new book by Joan Didion examines her thoughts, fears, and doubts regarding having children, illness, and growing old.  Blue Nights opens on July 26, 2010, as Didion thinks back to Quintana’s wedding in New York seven years before. Today would be her wedding anniversary. This fact triggers vivid snapshots of Quintana’s childhood—in Malibu, in Brentwood, at school in Holmby Hills. Reflecting on her daughter but also on her role as a parent, Didion asks the candid questions any parent might about how she feels she failed either because cues were not taken or perhaps displaced. “How could I have missed what was clearly there to be seen?” Finally, perhaps we all remain unknown to each other. Seamlessly woven in are incidents Didion sees as underscoring her own age, something she finds hard to acknowledge, much less accept.  Blue Nights—the long, light evening hours that signal the summer solstice, “the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but also its warning”—like The Year of Magical Thinking before it, is an iconic book of incisive and electric honesty, haunting and profoundly moving.",English,9780307267672,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Death', 'Essays', 'American', 'Contemporary']",[],Hardcover,,208,Knopf,November 1st 2011,,[],24569,"['6918', '9162', '6316', '1732', '441']",91.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1319148558l/10252302.jpg,97,1,2.37,10252302.0

History, that’s what. “Errgghhh boring boring bollocks boring, I had enough of that crap when I was at school. History just went on and on and on and on and on ….. and on and on. Nothing different ever happened.”Well that’s where you’re wrong, because I’m going to bring it alive. Not all history books, or even books about teaching history, have to be tedious. I’ve looked under every rock, in every nook and cranny. I’ve searched all over the place and dug up some really interesting little titbits. Stuff not a lot of people know. So stay with me on this one. I’ve chosen to look at past events from the birth of the planet to the birth of Christ. That’s enough for one book, isn’t it? Well, not really, because I’ve gone off track a little bit from time to time, but I do tend to do that so don’t worry about it.If you’ve got a teenager who’s studying the history of this period, download a copy for them now because it’s all laid out nice and clear. But let me warn you, I have in the past been accused of having an inappropriate sense of humour, so if you want a little bit of a chuckle watching me make fun out of everyone I meet down the years, then this is the book for you - and if your offspring is in their early teens then it probably isn’t the book for them.As I say, I do tend to stray into the modern day from time to time to bring things into focus, but I promise you this book will surprise you, inform you, keep you interested and put a smile on your face from time to time. I discuss philosophers and philosophy a lot, including ancient Greek philosophers, Chinese beliefs and philosophy from around the world, but if you think it’s all Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, there’s a lot more here to be discovered. You’ll be surprised, for instance, at the similarities between the Celts and the Native Americans. The Rosicrucians will fascinate you, as will some of the secrets held by Alexander the Great!

Much of the bombing was carried out against the expressed demands of the Allied military leadership. Hundreds of thousands of people died needlessly. Focusing on the crucial period from 1942 to 1945, and using a compelling narrative approach, Fire and Fury tells the story of the American and British bombing campaign through the eyes of those involved: military and civilian command in America, Britain, and Germany, aircrew in the sky, and civilians on the ground.Acclaimed historian Randall Hansen shows that the Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, Arthur Harris, was wedded to an outdated strategy whose success had never been proven; how area bombing not only failed to win the war, it probably prolonged it; and that the US campaign, which was driven by a particularly American fusion of optimism and morality, played an important and largely unrecognized role in delivering Allied victory.From the Hardcover edition.",English,9780385664042,"['History', 'World War II', 'Nonfiction', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'Military History', 'European History', 'Historical', 'Aviation']",[],Paperback,,368,Anchor Canada,September 15th 2009,October 7th 2008,[],221,"['60', '102', '43', '14', '2']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320393059l/7290754.jpg,46,1,20.27,7290754.0

In ""How to Hear from God,"" Joyce Meyer shows readers that God reaches out to people every day, seeking a partnership with them to offer guidance and love. She reveals the ways in which God delivers His word and the benefits of asking God for the sensitivity to hear His voice. Joyce asks the question, ""Are you listening?"" and shares how to do just that.",English,9780446532563,"['Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Christian Living', 'Inspirational', 'Self Help', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Faith']",[],Hardcover,,289,Faithwords,September 2nd 2003,09/01/03,[],1294,"['654', '390', '186', '47', '17']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1406336820l/13366.jpg,78,1,2.72,13366.0

His last book, Mortal Prey, was ""a model of the genre"" (People) and ""the cop novel of the year"" (Kirkus Reviews). In the words of the Washington Post: ""John Sandford does everything right.""Now, in Naked Prey, he puts Lucas Davenport through some changes. His old boss, Rose Marie Roux, has moved up to the state level and taken Lucas with her, creating a special troubleshooter job for him for the cases that are too complicated or politically touchy for others to handle. In addition, Lucas is married now, and a new father, all of which is fine with him: he doesn't mind being a family man. But he is a little worried. For every bit of peace you get, you have to pay — and he's waiting for the bill.It comes in the form of two people found hanging from a tree in the woods of northern Minnesota. What makes the situation particularly sensitive is that the bodies are of a black man and a white woman, and they're naked. ""Lynching"" is the word that everybody's trying not to say — but, as Lucas begins to discover, in fact the murders are nothing like what they appear to be, and they are not the end of it. There is worse to come — much, much worse.Filled with rich characterization and exceptional drama that are his hallmarks, this is Sandford's most suspenseful novel yet.

1389703.The_Lady_in_the_Van,The Lady in the Van,,Alan Bennett,3.72,"Life imitates art in The Lady in the Van, the story of the itinerant Miss Shepherd, who lived in a van in Alan Bennett's driveway from the early 1970s until her death in 1989. It is doubtful that Bennett could have made up the eccentric Miss Shepherd if he tried, but his poignant, funny but unsentimental account of their strange relationship is akin to his best fictional screen writing.Bennett concedes that ""One seldom was able to do her a good turn without some thoughts of strangulation"", but as the plastic bags build up, the years pass by and Miss Shepherd moves into Bennett's driveway, a relationship is established which defines a certain moment in late 20th-century London life which has probably gone forever. The dissenting, liberal, middle-class world of Bennett and his peers comes into hilarious but also telling collision with the world of Miss Shepherd: ""there was a gap between our social position and our social obligations. It was in this gap that Miss Shepherd (in her van) was able to live"". Bennett recounts Miss Shepherd's bizarre escapades in his inimitable style, from her letter to the Argentinean Embassy at the height of the Falklands War, to her attempts to stand for Parliament and wangle an electric wheelchair out of the Social Services. Beautifully observed, The Lady in the Van is as notable for Bennett's attempts to uncover the enigmatic history of Miss Shepherd, as it is for its amusing account of her eccentric escapades. --Jerry Brotton",English,9781861971227,"['Nonfiction', 'Short Stories', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Humor', 'British Literature', 'Plays', 'Contemporary', 'Autobiography', '20th Century']",[],Paperback,,96,Profile Books,March 18th 1999,01/01/99,[],8764,"['2212', '3063', '2544', '712', '233']",89.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347498783l/1389703.jpg,94,1,1.45,1389703.0

762821.A_Sentimental_Journey,A Sentimental Journey,,"Laurence Sterne, Paul Goring (Editor, Introduction)",3.36,"A furiously witty response to Tobias Smollett's curmudgeonly 'Travels through France and Italy', Laurence Sterne's A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy became a hugely influential work of travel writing in its own right. This Penguin Classics edition includes an introduction and notes by Paul Goring.When Yorick, the roving narrator of Sterne's innovative final novel, sets off for France on a whim, he produces no ordinary travelogue. Jolting along in his coach from Calais, through Paris, and on towards the Italian border, the amiable parson is blithely unconcerned by famous views or monuments, but he engages us with tales of his encounters with all manner of people, from counts and noblewomen to beggars and chambermaids. And as drama piles upon drama, anecdote, flirtation and digression, Yorick's destination takes second place to an exhilarating voyage of emotional and erotic exploration. Interweaving sharp wit with warm humour and irony with genuine feeling, A Sentimental Journey paints a captivating picture of an Englishman's adventures abroad.In his introduction, Paul Goring discusses Sterne's literary career and his semi-autobiographical depiction of Yorick, and sets the novel within the context of eighteenth-century travel writing and the vogue of sentimental fiction. This edition also includes a chronology, updated further reading and notes.Laurence Sterne (1713-1768) graduated from Cambridge in 1737 and took holy orders, becoming a prebend in York Cathedral. His masterpiece, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman made him a celebrity but ill-health necessitated recuperative travel and A Sentimental Journey grew out of a seven-month trip through France and Italy. He died the year it was published, 1768.If you enjoyed A Sentimental Journey, you might like Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, also available in Penguin Classics.",English,9780140437799,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Travel', '18th Century', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'English Literature', 'Novels', 'France', 'Humor']",[],Paperback,,134,Penguin Classics,November 29th 2001,10/30/68,[],5274,"['1058', '1343', '1683', '828', '362']",77.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311644377l/762821.jpg,163,2,3.15,762821.0

How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?

Their decade-long marriage had survived years of war that took Chris, a U.S. Navy SEAL, away from Taya and their two children for agonizingly long stretches while he put his life on the line in many major battles of the Iraq War. After struggling to readjust to life out of the military, Chris had found new purpose in redirecting his lifelong dedication to service toward supporting veterans and their families. Their love had deepened, and their family was whole, finally.Then, the unthinkable. On February 2, 2013, Chris and his friend Chad Littlefield were killed while attempting to help a troubled vet. The life Chris and Taya fought so hard to build was shattered. In an instant, Taya became a single parent of two. A widow. A young woman facing the rest of her life without the man she loved.Chris and Taya's remarkable story has captivated millions through Clint Eastwood's blockbuster Academy Award-winning film American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper as Chris and Sienna Miller as Taya, and because of Chris's bestselling memoir, in which Taya contributed passages that formed the book's emotional core. Now, with trusted collaborator Jim DeFelice, Taya writes in never-before-told detail about the hours, days, and months after Chris's shocking death when grief threatened to overwhelm her.And yet throughout, friendship, family, and a deepening faith were lifelines that sustained her and the kids when the sorrow became too much. Two years after her husband's tragic death, Taya has found renewed meaning and connection to Chris by advancing their shared mission of ""serving those who serve others,"" particularly military and first-responder families. She and the children are now embracing a new future, one that honors the past but also looks forward with hope, gratitude, and joy.American Wife is one of the most remarkable memoirs of the year—a universal chronicle of love and heartbreak, service and sacrifice, faith and purpose that will inspire every reader.",English,9780062398086,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'True Story', 'Christian']",[],Hardcover,,329,William Morrow,May 4th 2015,05/01/15,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2015)'],4127,"['2071', '1287', '592', '125', '52']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1423605837l/23462662.jpg,89,1,3.29,23462662.0

 An exhilarating novel of reinvention, friendship, and ambition—from the Jersey Shore to St. Andrews in Scotland Tom Alison has it all within his reach. He’s smart, handsome, and about to graduate from a prestigious East Coast boarding school. After that it’s off to the Ivy League and then a job on Wall Street, alongside the power brokers he’s been watching from a distance as the working-class son of a single mom. And then the very life his mother worked so hard to escape catches up with him when he gets busted selling drugs. Lucky for Tom, there are places for boys and girls with ruined reputations. First, he returns to his roots on the Jersey Shore, reconnecting with a hard-living crew and cementing a bond with his new friend Clare Savage—the son of a recently disgraced financier. The two boys spend their summer surfing and partying. When fall arrives, they head to St. Andrews University in Scotland, a haven for Americans in need of a second chance and a favorite of the British rul­ing class. Tom and Clare escape to Scotland together, but it’s Tom who discovers a world shaped by even more powerful forces of greed and am­bition than the one he left behind. Sucked into a maelstrom of sex, drugs, and status, Tom learns what it takes to break the rules—and how we can be broken by them. Driven by a cast of young men and women living in an age of riotous prosperity, Down the Shore is an unflinching and unforgettable story of youth steeped in excess. Stan Parish has crafted a gripping novel that masterfully captures the lives of fallen financiers and the people they bring down with them—and reminds us that not even an ocean can separate us from our fam­ily, our friends, or our past.",,9780670016426,"['Fiction', 'Young Adult']",[],Hardcover,,288,Viking,May 29th 2014,,[],253,"['32', '63', '86', '50', '22']",72.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400867019l/18667780.jpg,88,1,3.13,18667780.0

Now, in his hilarious and heartfelt new novel, he envisions a deliciously dark tale of America’s dysfunctional coming years—and the timeless and tender feelings that just might bring us back from the brink.In a very near future—oh, let’s say next Tuesday—a functionally illiterate America is about to collapse. But don’t that tell that to poor Lenny Abramov, the thirty-nine-year-old son of an angry Russian immigrant janitor, proud author of what may well be the world’s last diary, and less-proud owner of a bald spot shaped like the great state of Ohio. Despite his job at an outfit called Post-Human Services, which attempts to provide immortality for its super-rich clientele, death is clearly stalking this cholesterol-rich morsel of a man. And why shouldn’t it? Lenny’s from a different century—he totally loves books (or “printed, bound media artifacts,” as they’re now known), even though most of his peers find them smelly and annoying. But even more than books, Lenny loves Eunice Park, an impossibly cute and impossibly cruel twenty-four-year-old Korean American woman who just graduated from Elderbird College with a major in Images and a minor in Assertiveness.After meeting Lenny on an extended Roman holiday, blistering Eunice puts that Assertiveness minor to work, teaching our “ancient dork” effective new ways to brush his teeth and making him buy a cottony nonflammable wardrobe. But America proves less flame-resistant than Lenny’s new threads. The country is crushed by a credit crisis, riots break out in New York’s Central Park, the city’s streets are lined with National Guard tanks on every corner, the dollar is so over, and our patient Chinese creditors may just be ready to foreclose on the whole mess. Undeterred, Lenny vows to love both Eunice and his homeland. He’s going to convince his fickle new love that in a time without standards or stability, in a world where single people can determine a dating prospect’s “hotness” and “sustainability” with the click of a button, in a society where the privileged may live forever but the unfortunate will die all too soon, there is still value in being a real human being.Wildly funny, rich, and humane, Super Sad True Love Story is a knockout novel by a young master, a book in which falling in love just may redeem a planet falling apart. ",English,9781400066407,"['Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Humor', 'Adult Fiction', 'American', 'Literature']","['Leonard Abramov', 'Eunice Park']",Hardcover,,331,Random House Publishing Group,July 27th 2010,07/06/10,"['Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize Nominee for Comic Fiction (2011)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2010)']",38049,"['6748', '12856', '11293', '4949', '2203']",81.0,"['Lower East Side, New York City, New York (United States)', 'New York City, New York (United States)', 'Lower Manhattan, New York City, New York (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320540909l/7334201.jpg,89,1,3.94,7334201.0

A cold case reopened -- and solved -- with dogged police work and new evidence. One of the shocking true crimes of passion and greed from Ann Rule's Crime Files.Former Marine sergeant and judo instructor Roland Pitre Jr. claimed it was all an elaborate plan to win back his wife's love -- it wasn't supposed to end with her dead body in the trunk of a car. Nearly twenty years later, he acknowledged that he had hired someone to kill his estranged wife in 1988, though his alleged excuse for why a monstrous ""mistake"" happened is as shocking and convoluted as the crime itself. Eventually, he was charged with first-degree murder in the long-unsolved death of Cheryl Pitre, after a mysterious witness betrayed Pitre to save his own skin.
